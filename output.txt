SOCCER - <PER> JAPAN </PER> GET LUCKY WIN , <MISC> CHINA </MISC> IN SURPRISE DEFEAT . 

<PER> Nadim Ladki </PER> 

<LOC> AL-AIN </LOC> , <LOC> United Arab Emirates </LOC> 1996-12-06 

<LOC> Japan </LOC> began the defence of their <MISC> Asian Cup </MISC> title with a lucky 2-1 win against <LOC> Syria </LOC> in a <MISC> Group C </MISC> championship match on Friday . 

But <ORG> China </ORG> saw their luck desert them in the second match of the group , crashing to a surprise 2-0 defeat to newcomers <ORG> Uzbekistan </ORG> . 

<LOC> China </LOC> controlled most of the match and saw several chances missed until the 78th minute when <ORG> Uzbek </ORG> striker <PER> Igor Shkvyrin </PER> took advantage of a misdirected defensive header to lob the ball over the advancing <MISC> Chinese </MISC> keeper and into an empty net . 

<PER> Oleg Shatskiku </PER> made sure of the win in injury time , hitting an unstoppable left foot shot from just outside the area . 

The former <MISC> Soviet </MISC> republic was playing in an <MISC> Asian Cup </MISC> finals tie for the first time . 

Despite winning the <MISC> Asian Games </MISC> title two years ago , <LOC> Uzbekistan </LOC> are in the finals as outsiders . 

Two goals from defensive errors in the last six minutes allowed <LOC> Japan </LOC> to come from behind and collect all three points from their opening meeting against <LOC> Syria </LOC> . 

<PER> Takuya Takagi </PER> scored the winner in the 88th minute , rising to head a <ORG> Hiroshige Yanagimoto </ORG> cross towards the <MISC> Syrian </MISC> goal which goalkeeper <PER> Salem Bitar </PER> appeared to have covered but then allowed to slip into the net . 

It was the second costly blunder by <LOC> Syria </LOC> in four minutes . 

Defender <PER> Hassan Abbas </PER> rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of <PER> Bitar </PER> 's goal . 

<PER> Nader Jokhadar </PER> had given <LOC> Syria </LOC> the lead with a well-struck header in the seventh minute . 

<LOC> Japan </LOC> then laid siege to the <MISC> Syrian </MISC> penalty area for most of the game but rarely breached the <MISC> Syrian </MISC> defence . 

<PER> Bitar </PER> pulled off fine saves whenever they did . 

<ORG> Japan </ORG> coach <PER> Shu Kamo </PER> said : ' ' The <MISC> Syrian </MISC> own goal proved lucky for us . 

The <MISC> Syrians </MISC> scored early and then played defensively and adopted long balls which made it hard for us . ' 

' 

<PER> Japan </PER> , co-hosts of the <MISC> World Cup </MISC> in 2002 and ranked 20th in the world by <ORG> FIFA </ORG> , are favourites to regain their title here . 

<ORG> Hosts UAE </ORG> play <LOC> Kuwait </LOC> and <LOC> South Korea </LOC> take on <LOC> Indonesia </LOC> on Saturday in <MISC> Group A </MISC> matches . 

All four teams are level with one point each from one game .

<ORG> RUGBY UNION </ORG> - <ORG> CUTTITTA </ORG> BACK FOR ITALY AFTER A YEAR . 

<LOC> ROME </LOC> 1996-12-06 

Italy recalled <PER> Marcello Cuttitta </PER> 

on Friday for their friendly against <LOC> Scotland </LOC> at <LOC> Murrayfield </LOC> more than a year after the 30-year-old wing announced he was retiring following differences over selection . 

<PER> Cuttitta </PER> , who trainer <PER> George Coste </PER> said was certain to play on Saturday week , was named in a 21-man squad lacking only two of the team beaten 54-21 by <LOC> England </LOC> at <LOC> Twickenham </LOC> last month . 

<PER> Stefano Bordon </PER> is out through illness and <PER> Coste </PER> said he had dropped back row <PER> Corrado Covi </PER> , who had been recalled for the <LOC> England </LOC> game after five years out of the national team . 

<PER> Cuttitta </PER> announced his retirement after the 1995 <MISC> World Cup </MISC> , where he took issue with being dropped from the <LOC> Italy </LOC> side that faced <LOC> England </LOC> in the pool stages . 

<PER> Coste </PER> said he had approached the player two months ago about a comeback . 

" He ended the <MISC> World Cup </MISC> on the wrong note , " <PER> Coste </PER> said . 

" I thought it would be useful to have him back and he said he would be available . 

I think now is the right time for him to return . " 

Squad : <PER> Javier Pertile </PER> , <PER> Paolo Vaccari </PER> , <PER> Marcello Cuttitta </PER> , <PER> Ivan Francescato </PER> , <PER> Leandro Manteri </PER> , <PER> Diego Dominguez </PER> , <PER> Francesco Mazzariol </PER> , <PER> Alessandro Troncon </PER> , <PER> Orazio Arancio </PER> , <PER> Andrea Sgorlon </PER> , <PER> Massimo Giovanelli </PER> , <PER> Carlo Checchinato </PER> , <PER> Walter Cristofoletto </PER> , <PER> Franco Properzi Curti </PER> , <PER> Carlo Orlandi </PER> , <PER> Massimo Cuttitta </PER> , <PER> Giambatista Croci </PER> , <PER> Gianluca Guidi </PER> , <PER> Nicola Mazzucato </PER> , <PER> Alessandro Moscardi </PER> , <PER> Andrea Castellani </PER> .

SOCCER - <PER> LATE </PER> GOALS GIVE JAPAN WIN OVER SYRIA . 

<LOC> AL-AIN </LOC> , <LOC> United Arab Emirates </LOC> 1996-12-06 

Two goals in the last six minutes gave holders <ORG> Japan </ORG> an uninspiring 2-1 <MISC> Asian Cup </MISC> victory over <LOC> Syria </LOC> on Friday . 

<PER> Takuya Takagi </PER> headed the winner in the 88th minute of the group C game after goalkeeper <PER> Salem Bitar </PER> spoiled a mistake-free display by allowing the ball to slip under his body . 

It was the second <MISC> Syrian </MISC> defensive blunder in four minutes . 

Defender <PER> Hassan Abbas </PER> rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of <PER> Bitar </PER> 's goal . 

<LOC> Syria </LOC> had taken the lead from their first serious attack in the seventh minute . 

<PER> Nader Jokhadar </PER> headed a cross from the right by <PER> Ammar Awad </PER> into the top right corner of <PER> Kenichi Shimokawa </PER> 's goal . 

<ORG> Japan </ORG> then laid siege to the <MISC> Syrian </MISC> penalty area and had a goal disallowed for offside in the 16th minute . 

A minute later , <PER> Bitar </PER> produced a good double save , first from <PER> Kazuyoshi Miura </PER> 's header and then blocked a <ORG> Takagi </ORG> follow-up shot . 

<PER> Bitar </PER> saved well again from <PER> Miura </PER> in the 37th minute , parrying away his header from a corner . 

<PER> Japan </PER> started the second half brightly but <PER> Bitar </PER> denied them an equaliser when he dived to his right to save <PER> Naoki Soma </PER> 's low drive in the 53rd minute . 

<LOC> Japan </LOC> : 19 - <PER> Kenichi Shimokawa </PER> , 2 - <PER> Hiroshige Yanagimoto </PER> , 3 - <PER> Naoki Soma </PER> , 4 - <PER> Masami Ihara </PER> , 5 - <PER> Norio Omura </PER> , 6 - <PER> Motohiro Yamaguchi </PER> , 8 - <PER> Masakiyo Maezono </PER> ( 7 - <PER> Yasuto Honda </PER> 71 ) , 9 - <PER> Takuya Takagi </PER> , 10 - <PER> Hiroshi Nanami </PER> , 11 - <PER> Kazuyoshi Miura </PER> , 15 - <PER> Hiroaki Morishima </PER> ( 14 - <PER> Masayuki Okano </PER> 75 ) .

Centre <PER> Jason Little </PER> will miss <LOC> Australia </LOC> 's end-of-tour fixture against the <MISC> Barbarians </MISC> at <LOC> Twickenham </LOC> on Saturday . 

<PER> Little </PER> has opted not to risk aggravating the knee injury which ruled him out of a large chunk of the tour and is replaced by fellow Queenslander <PER> Daniel Herbert </PER> . 

<PER> Owen Finegan </PER> has recovered from the knocks he took in last weekend 's test against <PER> Wales </PER> and retains his place in the back-row ahead of <PER> Daniel Manu </PER> . 

The <ORG> Wallabies </ORG> have their sights set on a 13th successive victory to end their <MISC> European </MISC> tour with a 100 percent record but also want to turn on the style and provide <PER> David Campese </PER> with a fitting send-off in his final match in <MISC> Australian </MISC> colours . 

The <ORG> Wallabies </ORG> currently have no plans to make any special presentation to the 34-year-old winger but a full house of 75,000 spectators will still gather in the hope of witnessing one last moment of magic . 

<PER> Campese </PER> will be up against a familiar foe in the shape of <MISC> Barbarians </MISC> captain <PER> Rob Andrew </PER> , the man who kicked <LOC> Australia </LOC> to defeat with a last-ditch drop-goal in the <MISC> World Cup </MISC> quarter-final in <LOC> Cape Town </LOC> . 

" <PER> Campo </PER> has a massive following in this country and has had the public with him ever since he first played here in 1984 , " said <PER> Andrew </PER> , also likely to be making his final <MISC> Twickenham </MISC> appearance . 

On tour , <LOC> Australia </LOC> have won all four tests against <LOC> Italy </LOC> , <LOC> Scotland </LOC> , <LOC> Ireland </LOC> and <LOC> Wales </LOC> , and scored 414 points at an average of almost 35 points a game .

CRICKET - <PER> LARA </PER> ENDURES ANOTHER MISERABLE DAY . 

<PER> Robert Galvin </PER> 

<LOC> MELBOURNE </LOC> 1996-12-06 

<LOC> Australia </LOC> gave <PER> Brian Lara </PER> another reason to be miserable when they beat <PER> West Indies </PER> by five wickets in the opening <MISC> World Series </MISC> limited overs match on Friday . 

<PER> Lara </PER> , disciplined for misconduct on Wednesday , was dismissed for five to extend a disappointing run of form on tour . 

<LOC> Australia </LOC> , who hold a 2-0 lead in the five-match test series , overhauled <PER> West Indies </PER> ' total of 172 all out with eight balls to spare to end a run of six successive one-day defeats . 

All-rounder <PER> Greg Blewett </PER> steered his side to a comfortable victory with an unbeaten 57 in 90 balls to the delight of the 42,442 crowd . 

Man-of-the match <PER> Blewett </PER> came to the wicket with the total on 70 for two and hit three fours during an untroubled innings lasting 129 minutes . 

His crucial fifth-wicket partnership with fellow all-rounder <PER> Stuart Law </PER> , who scored 21 , added 71 off 85 balls . 

<PER> Lara </PER> looked out of touch during his brief stay at the crease before chipping a simple catch to <PER> Shane Warne </PER> at mid-wicket . 

West <MISC> Indies </MISC> tour manager <PER> Clive Lloyd </PER> has apologised for <PER> Lara </PER> 's behaviour on Tuesday . 

He ( <PER> Lara </PER> ) had told <ORG> Australia </ORG> coach <PER> Geoff Marsh </PER> that wicketkeeper <PER> Ian Healy </PER> was unwelcome in the visitors ' dressing room . 

The <PER> Melbourne </PER> crowd were clearly angered by the incident , loudly jeering the <MISC> West Indies </MISC> vice-captain as he walked to the middle . 

It was left to fellow left-hander <PER> Shivnarine Chanderpaul </PER> to hold the innings together with a gritty 54 despite the handicap of an injured groin . 

<PER> Chanderpaul </PER> was forced to rely on a runner for most of his innings after hurting himself as he scurried back to his crease to avoid being run out . 

<LOC> Pakistan </LOC> , who arrive in <LOC> Australia </LOC> later this month , are the other team competing in the <MISC> World Series </MISC> tournament .

CRICKET - <PER> LARA </PER> SUFFERS MORE <PER> AUSTRALIAN </PER> TOUR MISERY . 

<LOC> MELBOURNE </LOC> 1996-12-06 

West <MISC> Indies </MISC> batsman <PER> Brian Lara </PER> suffered another blow to his <MISC> Australian </MISC> tour , after already being disciplined for misconduct , when he was dismissed cheaply in the first limited overs match against <LOC> Australia </LOC> on Friday . 

<PER> Lara </PER> , who earned a stern rebuke from his own tour management after an angry outburst against <LOC> Australia </LOC> wicketkeeper <PER> Ian Healy </PER> , scored five to prolong a run of poor form with the bat . 

The <MISC> West Indies </MISC> vice-captain struggled for timing during his 36-minute stay at the crease before chipping a ball from medium pacer <PER> Tom Moody </PER> straight to <PER> Shane Warne </PER> at mid-wicket . 

<PER> West Indies </PER> were 53 for two in 15 overs when rain stopped play at the <ORG> Melbourne Cricket Ground </ORG> after captain <PER> Courtney Walsh </PER> won the toss and elected to bat . 

<PER> Lara </PER> 's outburst three days ago has clearly turned some of the <MISC> Australian </MISC> public against him . 

As he walked to the wicket he was greeted by loud jeers from sections of the crowd . 

On several occasions during his innings , the crowd joined together in a series of obscene chants against him . 

Tour manager <PER> Clive Lloyd </PER> on Wednesday apologised for <PER> Lara </PER> 's behaviour in confronting <LOC> Australia </LOC> coach <PER> Geoff Marsh </PER> in the opposition dressing room to protest against his dismissal in the second test on Tuesday . 

<PER> Lloyd </PER> did not say what form the discipline would take . 

<PER> Lara </PER> , who holds the record for the highest score in test and first-class cricket , was unhappy about <PER> Healy </PER> 's role in the incident and questioned whether the ball had carried to the <LOC> Australia </LOC> keeper . 

<LOC> Australia </LOC> went on to win the match at the <ORG> Sydney Cricket Ground </ORG> by 124 runs to take a two-nil lead in the five-test series after <PER> Lara </PER> failed in both innings . 

<PER> Lara </PER> has yet to score a century since <PER> West Indies </PER> arrived in <LOC> Australia </LOC> five weeks ago . 

Both <PER> West Indies </PER> and <LOC> Australia </LOC> team management have played down the incident , stressing that relations between the two sides have not been adversely affected . 

<LOC> Pakistan </LOC> , who arrive next week , are the third team in the triangular <MISC> World Series </MISC> tournament .

At least four people have been shot dead in two suspected political attacks in <LOC> South Africa </LOC> 's volatile <LOC> Zulu </LOC> heartland , police said on Friday . 

A police spokesman said two youths believed to be supporters of President <PER> Nelson Mandela </PER> 's <ORG> African National Congress </ORG> ( <ORG> ANC </ORG> ) had been killed when unknown gunmen opened fire at the rural settlement of <LOC> Izingolweni </LOC> on <LOC> KwaZulu-Natal </LOC> province 's south coast on Thursday night . 

The victims were 18 and 20 , he said , adding one other youth had been wounded in the shooting . 

In another attack , also on the province 's south coast on Thursday night , two men were shot dead near <LOC> Umkomaas </LOC> . 

" We suspect that these killings are linked to politics , " spokesman <PER> Bala Naidoo </PER> told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> . 

There had been no arrests . 

The killings came just hours after violence monitors said they were not optimistic of a peaceful festive season in <LOC> KwaZulu-Natal </LOC> and pointed the south coast region where 18 people were massacred last <LOC> Christmas </LOC> as one of potential hot spots . 

They said the recent lull in political feuding could be upset as thousands of migrant workers , some tense with grudges brewed in the cities and keen to settle old scores , flock back to their home villages . 

More than 14,000 people have lost their lives in over a decade of political turf wars between the <ORG> ANC </ORG> and <MISC> Zulu Chief </MISC> <PER> Mangosuthu Buthelezi </PER> 's <ORG> Inkatha Freedom Party </ORG> in the province .

HAVEL PRAISES CZECH NATIVE ALBRIGHT AS FRIEND . 

<PER> Klara Gajduskova </PER> 

<LOC> PRAGUE </LOC> 1996-12-06 

<MISC> Czech </MISC> President <PER> Vaclav Havel </PER> on Friday welcomed the appointment of <ORG> Madeleine Albright </ORG> , who is of <MISC> Czech </MISC> extraction , as the <LOC> United States </LOC> ' first woman Secretary of State . 

In a statement <PER> Havel </PER> , who is recovering from cancer surgery , said : " <PER> Madeleine Albright </PER> is a distinguished friend , a tested diplomat , and a true <MISC> American </MISC> of fine origins . " 

" I look forward to continuing our good relations ... 

with the <LOC> United States </LOC> and with the first woman ever to hold the position of <ORG> Secretary of State </ORG> . 

I wish her well , " <PER> Havel </PER> said in a statement to <ORG> Reuters </ORG> . 

<PER> Havel </PER> , who helped lead the " velvet revolution " that ousted the <MISC> Communist </MISC> regime in <LOC> Prague </LOC> in 1989 , invited <PER> Albright </PER> , then working for a private foreign policy think tank , to advise his new democratic government in 1990 . 

<PER> Havel </PER> had a small malignant tumour removed from his lung on Monday and is recovering in hospital . 

Albright , born <PER> Marie Korbelova </PER> to a <MISC> Czechoslovak </MISC> diplomat in 1937 , fled with her family to the <LOC> United States </LOC> after the <ORG> Communists </ORG> came to power in a coup in 1948 . 

As an academic , <PER> Albright </PER> studied and lectured on <LOC> Europe </LOC> 's 20th century problems before becoming <LOC> U.S. </LOC> ambassador to the <ORG> United Nations </ORG> . 

<MISC> Czech </MISC> diplomats , seeking to have their country included in the expected expansion of <ORG> NATO </ORG> , praised the selection of <ORG> Albright </ORG> , known to be a strong supporter of alliance 's integration of former <MISC> Soveit-bloc </MISC> countries . 

" The nomination ...

CZECH VICE-PM SEES WIDER DEBATE AT PARTY CONGRESS . 

<LOC> PRAGUE </LOC> 1996-12-06 

Saturday 's national congress of the ruling <ORG> Czech Civic Democratic Party </ORG> ( <ORG> ODS </ORG> ) will discuss making the party more efficient and transparent , <ORG> Foreign Minister </ORG> and <ORG> ODS </ORG> vice-chairman <PER> Josef Zieleniec </PER> , said on Friday . 

" Modernisation and more profesionalism of the party 's structure , having financing of the party be more transparent ... 

are absolutely fundamental , " <PER> Zieleniec </PER> , who is also vice-premier in the government , told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> . 

He said after June general elections in which the ruling three-party coalition lost its parliamentary majority , the <ORG> ODS </ORG> executive , led by Prime Minister <PER> Vaclav Klaus </PER> , had developed proposals on these subjects to present at the congress on Saturday in the <MISC> Czech </MISC> second city <LOC> Brno </LOC> . 

" I am convinced , that the congress will tackle these proposals , " he said . 

The <ORG> ODS </ORG> , a party in which <PER> Klaus </PER> often tries to emulate the style of former <MISC> British </MISC> Prime Minister <PER> Margaret Thatcher </PER> , has been in control of <MISC> Czech </MISC> politics since winning general elections in 1992 . 

Zieleniec in the summer led calls for the party and its leadership to listen to more diverse opinions , a thinly-veiled criticism of <PER> Klaus </PER> who has spearheaded the country 's <MISC> post-Communist </MISC> economic reforms . 

The party , led by the vigorously-confident <PER> Klaus </PER> , took 32 of 81 seats after late November runoff elections to the new upper house of <MISC> Czech </MISC> parliament . 

But after the first round vote a week before , the <ORG> ODS </ORG> had the potential to win as many 79 seats . 

<PER> Klaus </PER> and his coalition lost its majority in parliament in June lower house elections after the left-wing opposition consolidated , putting the centre-left <ORG> Social Democrats </ORG> in a strong second-place position .

POLAND GOT MONEY FROM POST-WAR SWISS ACCOUNTS . 

<PER> Marcin Grajewski </PER> 

<LOC> WARSAW </LOC> 1996-12-06 

<LOC> Poland </LOC> said on Friday that <MISC> Swiss </MISC> bank accounts , which in many cases belonged to <MISC> Polish Jews </MISC> who died in the <MISC> Holocaust </MISC> , were used in debt settlements between the two countries after the <MISC> World War Two </MISC> . 

Foreign Minister <PER> Dariusz Rosati </PER> , unveiling first findings of a special government commission , said that in 1970s the then communist <LOC> Poland </LOC> received 460,000 <MISC> Swiss </MISC> francs from the accounts . 

" In 1970s , <LOC> Poland </LOC> received from unclaimed accounts in <LOC> Switzerland </LOC> a sum of 460,000 francs . 

What was its right ( to the money ) ...I do not know , " <PER> Rosati </PER> told a news conference . 

<LOC> Switzerland </LOC> stands accused by <PER> Senator Alfonse D'Amato </PER> , chairman of the powerful <ORG> U.S. Senate Banking Committee </ORG> , of agreeing to give money to <LOC> Poland </LOC> from unclaimed bank accounts of <MISC> Polish </MISC> citizens , as part of an accord on compensating <MISC> Swiss </MISC> nationals whose assets had been seized in communist <LOC> Poland </LOC> . 

Many of these citizens were <MISC> Jews </MISC> murdered during the war , when <MISC> Nazi German </MISC> invaders killed most of <LOC> Poland </LOC> 's 3.5 million <MISC> Jews </MISC> . 

<PER> Rosati </PER> did not say whether the payment in 1970s was part of the 1949 agreement between <LOC> Warsaw </LOC> and <LOC> Switzerland </LOC> on compensation to <MISC> Swiss </MISC> citizens whose assets were seized by the <MISC> Soviet-imposed </MISC> communists authorities after <PER> World War Two </PER> . 

" I expect that the commission will finish gathering information within two to three weeks and then more details will be provided , " <PER> Rosati </PER> said . 

<PER> Rosati </PER> confirmed that the 1949 agreement had provided for granting <LOC> Switzerland </LOC> about 53 million francs and most of this sum was repaid with coal exports . 

He said , however , that <LOC> Switzerland </LOC> did get about 16,000 francs from the so-called " dead accounts " as part of the compensation . 

" About 16,000 francs were seized from accounts of four or five <MISC> Polish </MISC> citizens , whose data we do not precisely know . 

The issue is of moral and legal nature , because its financial significance is small , " <PER> Rosati </PER> said . 

Under pressure from international <MISC> Jewish </MISC> organisations , <MISC> Swiss </MISC> government has devised a plan to pay out millions of dollars in unclaimed bank accounts as a conciliatory gesture toward <LOC> Holocaust </LOC> victims . 

The conservative <ORG> Radical Democrats </ORG> ( <ORG> FDP </ORG> ) have said they would ask parliament next week to order <MISC> Swiss </MISC> banks to put some 40 million <MISC> Swiss </MISC> francs ( $ 31 million ) in dormant wealth into a fund earmarked for <MISC> Jewish </MISC> groups and charitable organisations . 

But <MISC> Swiss </MISC> banks and the country 's <MISC> Jewish </MISC> community voiced doubts whether the plan would work .

INTERVIEW-ZYWIEC SEES NO BIG 97 NET RISE . 

<PER> Steven Silber </PER> 

<LOC> WARSAW </LOC> 1996-12-06 

<MISC> Polish </MISC> brewer <PER> Zywiec </PER> 's 1996 profit slump may last into next year due in part to hefty depreciation charges , but recent high investment should help the firm defend its 10-percent market share , the firm 's chief executive said . 

Company President <PER> Jean van Boxmeer </PER> told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> in an interview on Friday that the firm , whose net profit fell 77 percent in the first 10 months of 1996 despite a 30-percent rise in sales , might only post slightly better profits in 1997 before having a chance to make a more significant turnaround . 

So far this year <ORG> Zywiec </ORG> , whose full name is <ORG> Zaklady Piwowarskie </ORG> w <ORG> Zywcu SA </ORG> , has netted six million zlotys on sales of 224 million zlotys . 

It has produced 1.5 million hectolitres . 

<ORG> Van Boxmeer </ORG> would not say how much higher 1997 profits or market share could be but said sales of leading <MISC> Polish </MISC> brewers should rise as the country 's young urban professionals gradually switch from vodka to beer . 

" The perspective on growth is such that reasonably we can think that somewhere between 65 and 80 litres per year is certainly reachable , " <PER> van Boxmeer </PER> said on <MISC> Polish </MISC> per-capita beer consumption , currently around 40 litres . 

He said the 65-80-litre level could be reached in the next ten years and make <LOC> Poland </LOC> , with its 40-million population , <LOC> Europe </LOC> 's third largest beer market after <LOC> Germany </LOC> and <LOC> Britain </LOC> . 

<ORG> Van Boxmeer </ORG> said <LOC> Poland </LOC> 's top five brewers , which produce about 55 percent of the country 's beer , could all raise market share as some of the numerous small brewers fall to competition from the large brewers with foreign investors . 

<MISC> Zywiec </MISC> is 31.8-percent owned by <PER> Heineken </PER> while <ORG> Carlsberg </ORG> has the same amount in <LOC> Okocim </LOC> . 

Earlier this year <ORG> South African Breweries Ltd </ORG> ( <ORG> SAB </ORG> ) bought strategic stakes in the unlisted <ORG> Lech </ORG> and <ORG> Tychy </ORG> brewers , which together hold more than 20 percent of the market , and <LOC> Australia </LOC> 's <ORG> Brewpole BV </ORG> has a controlling stake in <LOC> Poland </LOC> 's larges t brewery , <ORG> Elbrewery Company Ltd. </ORG> ( <ORG> EB </ORG> ) . 

<ORG> Van Boxmeer </ORG> said the tough competition had prevented <LOC> Zywiec </LOC> from raising prices in line with inflation , which had added to the pressure on the firm 's margins . 

He said advertising costs would also increase in the fight for market share . 

But he said the company 's investment of more than $ 100 million already this decade , largely in production , would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from the neighbouring <LOC> Czech Republic </LOC> . 

Some analysts say cheaper but high-quality <MISC> Czech </MISC> imports could invade <LOC> Poland </LOC> once tariffs for <ORG> CEFTA </ORG> countries are lifted in 1998 , but <PER> van Boxmeer </PER> says such a threat might be exaggerated despite the <MISC> Czech </MISC> beer market 's overcapacity . 

" I think <MISC> Polish </MISC> consumers in general are quite proud of their beers -- and I 'm speaking about all the brands -- and as we make good beers ... 

I think that this fidelity to our beers is a factor which can limit the <MISC> Czech </MISC> beers , " he said . 

<ORG> Van Boxmeer </ORG> said <ORG> Zywiec </ORG> had its eye on <ORG> Okocim </ORG> , which has said it would start producing <ORG> Carlsberg </ORG> beer next year , but that <ORG> Zywiec </ORG> 's potential production of <ORG> Heineken </ORG> was a medium-term possibility rather than a short-term one . 

He said his firm would be better off concentrating on its leading brand , <ORG> Zywiec Full Light </ORG> , which accounts for 85 percent of sales and is the country 's largest-selling brand . 

" You will not win the war of the <MISC> Polish </MISC> beer market with imported international brands , " <PER> van Boxmeer </PER> said , adding that <PER> Heineken </PER> would remain an up-market import in <LOC> Poland </LOC> . 

<ORG> Van Boxmeer </ORG> also said <PER> Zywiec </PER> would be boosted by its recent shedding of soft drinks which only accounted for about three percent of the firm 's overall sales and for which 7.6 million zlotys in provisions had already been made .

<LOC> Britain </LOC> sets conditions to clear <MISC> American </MISC> alliance . 

<PER> Edna Fernandes </PER> 

<LOC> LONDON </LOC> 1996-12-06 

The <MISC> British </MISC> government warned Friday that it would refer the proposed <MISC> trans-Atlantic </MISC> alliance between <MISC> British </MISC> <ORG> Airways Plc and American Airlines </ORG> to <LOC> Britain </LOC> 's <ORG> Monopolies </ORG> and <ORG> Mergers Commission </ORG> unless the carriers complied with a number of conditions . 

Trade and Industry Secretary <PER> Ian Lang </PER> added that even if the conditions were met by both airlines , final clearance would hinge on an open skies deal between <LOC> Britain </LOC> and the <LOC> United States </LOC> to liberalise <MISC> trans-Atlantic </MISC> air traffic , which would create greater competition on the routes . 

<PER> Lang </PER> said he supported conditions proposed by <LOC> Britain </LOC> 's Office of <LOC> Fair Trading </LOC> , which was asked to examine the case last month . 

" I agree ... that without suitable undertakings the alliance would be likely to lead to a significant loss of actual and potential passengers , on those routes where <ORG> BA </ORG> and <LOC> AA </LOC> currently compete and for all passengers on the <MISC> trans-Atlantic </MISC> market route between the <LOC> UK </LOC> and <LOC> U.S. </LOC> , " he said . 

His comments came just minutes after the latest set of open skies talks ended in <LOC> London </LOC> with no deal signed . 

Industry sources said there was no new date for fresh talks and blamed the deadlock on uncertainty over whether the <MISC> British Airways-American </MISC> deal would be cleared . 

The conditions for clearance of the alliance were that <MISC> British Airways </MISC> and <MISC> American </MISC> drop 168 slots at <LOC> London Heathrow </LOC> airport , the busiest in <LOC> Europe </LOC> . 

<ORG> American </ORG> 's parent , <ORG> AMR Corp. </ORG> , said it did not view the terms as a " deal breaker . " 

However , it called the conditions " more severe " than those imposed by other regulatory authorities on similar airline alliances . 

<ORG> British Airways </ORG> 's initial response was that " unconditional divestiture of slots is unprecedented and if done it must be on the basis of fair market value . " 

It added that it would be " prepared to take reasonable steps to assist the introduction of additional competition . " 

The government also wants <ORG> British Airways </ORG> to drop a clause in its agreement with <ORG> USAir </ORG> that bars it from competing on <MISC> trans-Atlantic </MISC> routes , and said both <MISC> British </MISC> <ORG> Airways </ORG> and <MISC> American </MISC> should be prepared to reduce services on the <LOC> London </LOC> to <ORG> Dallas-Fort Worth </ORG> route in the event that a new entrant wishes to enter . 

It also suggested losing some slots on the <LOC> London-to-Boston </LOC> route . 

The <ORG> Office of Fair Trade </ORG> called for <ORG> British Airways </ORG> / <MISC> American </MISC> to allow third-party access to their joint frequent flyer programme where the applicant does not have access to an equivalent programme . 

<PER> Lang </PER> said responses should be made to the <ORG> Office of Fair Trading </ORG> by Jan. 10 , 1997 .

Med oil products mostly lower as <ORG> Elf </ORG> strike ends . 

<LOC> LONDON </LOC> 1996-12-06 

<MISC> Mediterranean </MISC> oil products were steady to mostly lower on Friday after <ORG> Elf </ORG> refinery workers voted to end their nine-day strike . 

Gas oil erased Thursday 's gains , plunging $ 5.50 a tonne in line with the screen . 

Volume was very thin and market remained long , with premiums down $ 1 at about high cif quotes +$0.50 basis Genoa . " 

The sharp moves on the screen make everyone nervous , " a trader said . 

Trades were discussed in 0.2 , 0.5 and one percent heating oil into <LOC> Syria </LOC> and <LOC> Lebanon </LOC> and there were fresh inquiries from <LOC> France </LOC> and <LOC> Spain </LOC> for low sulphur diesel . 

<ORG> Interest </ORG> remains focussed on a tender by <LOC> India </LOC> for a second purchase of high speed diesel for January delivery . 

Fuel oil lost ground sharply with weaker crude , but also suffered from some pricing pressure . 

High sulphur cracked fuel lost about $ 3 to $ 109-111 fob Med with several cargoes threatening to overhang the market . 

The chance of material heading north , talked earlier this week , may be in jeopardy now since <MISC> American </MISC> fuel oil is expected to head transatlantic following outages at two coking units in the <LOC> U.S </LOC> . 

Up to 165,000 tonnes of fuel will have to find a new home and with the arbitrage from the <LOC> U.S. </LOC> to <LOC> Europe </LOC> open <LOC> Rotterdam </LOC> is a prime candidate . 

Low sulphur prices were lower with cif Med pegged in the mid to low $ 140s . 

Gasoline prices fell after striking <ORG> Elf </ORG> refinery workers voted to go back to work , traders said . 

But an open arbitrage to the <LOC> U.S. </LOC> and tight <MISC> Italian </MISC> supplies after <LOC> Elf </LOC> scooped up Med material over the last week , continued to underpin prices into next week .

New meningitis scare hits <LOC> Britain </LOC> . 

<LOC> LONDON </LOC> 1996-12-06 

A boy has died from meningitis and a girl from the same school has contracted the disease in the second such scare to hit <LOC> Britain </LOC> in as many weeks , health authorities said on Friday . 

The 16-year-old who attended <LOC> Sale Grammar School </LOC> in the northern <LOC> England </LOC> city of <LOC> Manchester </LOC> died less than a day after becoming ill . 

The 15-year-old girl is also suffering from the disease and hospital officials described her condition as serious . 

" At the moment there is no evidence the two cases are linked . 

However , we are assuming they are as a precaution for the time being , " a spokeswoman said . 

The more than 1,260 students at the school are being given antibiotics as a precaution . 

Wales grappled with its own cluster of meningitis cases on a university campus in <LOC> Cardiff </LOC> . 

At least two people have died and hundreds have been vaccinated in an effort to contain the virus . 

In <LOC> Scotland </LOC> , eight people have died and hundreds more are fighting a widespread food-poisoning outbreak .

Three were listed in poor condition . 

More than 290 people have reported symptoms in <LOC> Lanarkshire </LOC> county , the worst-hit area , since the outbreak first came to light after people ate tainted meat pies at a pensioners ' lunch .

<ORG> New York City </ORG> on Friday said that it planned a $ 775 million refunding for January that will include its first floating rate issue of taxable debt for <MISC> European </MISC> investors . 

A city official , who declined to be named , explained that <PER> Goldman </PER> , <PER> Sachs </PER> , which this summer was demoted to the second tier of the syndicate , proposed the floating rate issue and as a result was promoted to book runner for this offering . 

By selling the floating rate debt , the city hopes to establish a benchmark , the city official said , adding that it needed a large deal to accomplish this objective . 

The city in late June sold its first issue of <ORG> Euronotes </ORG> , a strategy that it says saved it $ 500,000 in interest costs , and it has been trying to build on this strategy of expanding the pool of potential investors since then . 

In <LOC> November </LOC> , <ORG> New York City </ORG> said it became the first <LOC> U.S. </LOC> municipality to offer bonds for sale in <MISC> European </MISC> markets by competitive bidding as it listed taxable bonds on the <ORG> London Stock Exchange </ORG> .

<ORG> Wall St </ORG> speculates about <ORG> Santa Fe </ORG> savior . 

<PER> Brendan Intindola </PER> 

<LOC> NEW YORK </LOC> 1996-12-06 

<ORG> Homestake Mining Co </ORG> tops <PER> Wall Street </PER> 's list as the most likely white knight buyer for <ORG> Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corp </ORG> if <ORG> Santa Fe </ORG> rejects unsolicited suitor <PER> Newmont Mining Corp </PER> . 

<ORG> Santa Fe </ORG> is so far mum on the more than $ 2 billion stock swap takeover proposal from <LOC> Newmont </LOC> , announced Thursday . 

<PER> Wall Street </PER> , since the bid , has speculated that any deal between <LOC> Newmont </LOC> and <ORG> Santa Fe </ORG> would be a " bear hug , " or a reluctantly negotiated agreement where the buyer is not necessarily a friendly suitor . 

<PER> Newmont </PER> said the companies have had previous contact , though declined to detail the encounters . 

Analysts predict <ORG> Santa Fe </ORG> will go to the highest bidder , and that if a rival buyer is found , <ORG> Newmont </ORG> may not be able to match its offer . 

They said the <ORG> Santa Fe </ORG> deal , which includes desirable <LOC> Nevada </LOC> mining territory , would only payoff for <LOC> Newmont </LOC> longer term . 

Newmont , in fact , will not benefit from the <ORG> Santa Fe </ORG> acquisition on an earnings basis for at least two years , which also limits its capacity to raise its offer . 

Any deal , friendly or hostile , would almost assuredly be a stock swap , which is necessary to preserve the tax-free , pooling-of-interest accounting , they said . 

Analysts and arbitrageurs immediately ruled out <ORG> Barrick Gold Corp </ORG> and <ORG> Bre-X Minerals Ltd </ORG> as <ORG> Santa Fe </ORG> saviors because they are locked in negotiations over their splitting <LOC> Indonesia </LOC> 's <LOC> Busang </LOC> vast gold deposit . 

Placer <PER> Dome Inc </PER> too was considered unlikley because it is focusing on geographic expansion in areas that do match <ORG> Santa Fe </ORG> 's <LOC> Nevada </LOC> , <LOC> South America </LOC> and <ORG> Central Asia </ORG> presence , they said . 

A <ORG> Homestake </ORG> spokesman was not immediately available to comment on speculation that it tops the list . 

<ORG> Homestake </ORG> , based in <LOC> San Francisco </LOC> , operates gold mines in the <LOC> United States </LOC> , <LOC> Australia </LOC> , <LOC> Chile </LOC> and <LOC> Canada </LOC> . 

Earnings in 1995 were $ 0.22 per share , or $ 30.3 million , on revenues of $ 746.3 million . 

<ORG> Santa Fe </ORG> is headquartered <ORG> Albuquerque </ORG> , <ORG> N.M. </ORG> and reported 1995 earnings of $ 0.30 per share , or $ 40 million , on revenues of $ 350 million . 

<ORG> Santa Fe </ORG> has mining and exploration operations in <LOC> Nevada </LOC> , <LOC> California </LOC> , <LOC> Montana </LOC> , <LOC> Canada </LOC> , <LOC> Brazil </LOC> , <LOC> Australia </LOC> , <LOC> Chile </LOC> , <LOC> Kazakstan </LOC> , <LOC> Mexico </LOC> and <LOC> Ghana </LOC> . 

PaineWebber analyst <PER> Marc Cohen </PER> said he lowered his rating on <ORG> Newmont </ORG> to neutral from attractive today because if <ORG> Newmont </ORG> merged with <ORG> Santa Fe </ORG> , investors would have to wait until the second half of 1998 to realize earnings accretion . 

" I think <PER> Homestake </PER> could come in as a white knight , but how much is someone willing to come in above the <LOC> Newmont </LOC> number . 

One would have to outbid by at least 15 percent , but there is going to be a ( <ORG> Santa Fe </ORG> ) deal with someone , " he said . 

" Longer term , two to three years out , ( a <ORG> Newmont-Santa Fe </ORG> deal ) is positive , it does all the right things . 

But in the near-term it is , at worst , neutral , " the analyst added . 

Newmont proposed to <ORG> Santa Fe </ORG> a stock-swap merger at a ratio of 0.33 <ORG> Newmont </ORG> shares for each <ORG> Santa Fe </ORG> shares . 

In Friday <LOC> New York Stock Exchange </LOC> trade , <ORG> Newmonth </ORG> was off 1/2 to 46-5/8 while <ORG> Santa Fe </ORG> added 1/4 to 15-1/8 . 

" Newmont said it wants to discuss a friendly deal with <ORG> Santa Fe </ORG> , which is almost always a euphemism for ' We have more money in our pocket , ' " said an arb , referring to a possible sweetened bid from <LOC> Newmont </LOC> . 

Two other arbs called <PER> Newmont </PER> 's move a " a 32 cent bid " because there is no formal tender offer , only the proposal letter " mailed " to <ORG> Santa Fe </ORG> 's board .

Multinational commander going back to east <LOC> Zaire </LOC> .

<LOC> NAIROBI </LOC> 1996-12-06 

The <MISC> Canadian </MISC> general in charge of a multinational force for eastern <LOC> Zaire </LOC> said on Friday he was going back to <LOC> Zaire </LOC> for more information about the plight of about 165,000 <MISC> Rwandan </MISC> refugees adrift in the countryside . 

Lieutenant-General <PER> Maurice Baril </PER> told a news conference in <LOC> Nairobi </LOC> his main concern was for a large group of about 150,000 refugees living off the land in a valley about 65 km ( 40 miles ) west of the eastern city of <LOC> Goma </LOC> . 

If he decided it was necessary and safe for the aircrew , he would not hesitate to order airdrops of food for the refugees , even against the wishes of the government in <LOC> Kinshasa </LOC> and the <MISC> Zairean </MISC> rebels who control much of eastern <LOC> Zaire </LOC> , he said . 

" Tomorrow I 'm going into <LOC> Rwanda </LOC> and my intention is to go across into eastern <LOC> Zaire </LOC> and try to find out for the second time what the situation is on the ground , " he said . 

General <PER> Baril </PER> saw rebel leader <PER> Laurent Kabila </PER> in <LOC> Goma </LOC> last week but the rebels told him the crisis was over because most of the <MISC> Rwandan </MISC> refugees have already gone home . 

The rebels do not want the multinational force to deploy on the ground , for fear it might help the <LOC> Zairean </LOC> army regain control of the area . 

<LOC> Kinshasa </LOC> opposes airdrops , apparently because the food could fall into the hands of the rebels and their local supporters . 

<MISC> Canadian </MISC> Defence Minister <PER> Doug Young </PER> said on Thursday that the multinational force would probably not have to make food airdrops or intervene militarily in any major way . 

" It does n't look as though they ( airdrops ) are going to be required in any significant way because the <ORG> NGOs </ORG> ( non-governmental organisations ) are in that area on the border between <LOC> Zaire </LOC> and <LOC> Rwanda </LOC> , " <PER> Young </PER> told reporters . 

But <PER> General Baril </PER> said it would be premature to rule out any course of action until he had more information . 

" We hope that if the front moves forward or stabilises then we will have access ( to the large group of refugees ) with reconnaissance or humanitarian agencies . 

" If they ca n't move because they are too weak , then we will probably consider very seriously using air delivery means ( airdrops ) ...It 's complex , it 's dangerous for the air crew that fly in there and it will have to be absolutely necessary . 

If it is necessary , I wo n't hesitate to use it , " he said . 

Asked if he would disregard the objections of the <LOC> Zairean </LOC> government , he said : " It would have to be in the last resort . 

It would have to mean that tens of thousands of lives are in danger . 

Do you think that I would have a conscience problem doing it or not at that time ? 

And my mandate is also under <ORG> Chapter Seven </ORG> to operate in eastern <LOC> Zaire </LOC> . " 

Under <PER> Chapter Seven </PER> of the <LOC> U.N. </LOC> charter , the <ORG> Security Council </ORG> has wide powers to preserve peace and security . 

" I know their ( the <LOC> Zairean </LOC> government 's ) position and I know it 's very delicate and we are very sensitive to their position also , " the general added . 

He denied that his contacts , criticised by <PER> Kinshasa </PER> , with the <MISC> Zairean </MISC> rebels amounted to negotiations . 

" I do n't negotiate , " he said . " 

I coordinate with those who are holding ground and that 's a wise thing to do . 

When we do n't know where the front is , we do n't know what the risk is . " 

<PER> Baril </PER> said that apart from the group of 150,000 , <LOC> U.S. </LOC> and <MISC> British </MISC> reconnaissance plans had tracked two much smaller groups of refugees -- one of up to 1,000 north of the town of <LOC> Masisi </LOC> and one of up to 8,000 on the road from <LOC> Bukavu </LOC> west to <LOC> Kindu </LOC> . 

The <MISC> Kisangani </MISC> office of the medical charity <ORG> Medecins sans Frontieres </ORG> said on Friday that more than 100,000 refugees were trekking northwest from the <LOC> Goma-Bukavu </LOC> area and many of them were now in the town of <LOC> Walikale </LOC> . 

The general did not mention these refugees , who are on the outer limit of the strip the planes have been checking .

Ex-minister , son killed in <LOC> Central Africa </LOC> unrest .

<LOC> BANGUI </LOC> 1996-12-06 

A former cabinet minister in <LOC> Central African Republic </LOC> and his son were abducted from their home and murdered in growing ethnic violence in the capital <LOC> Bangui </LOC> , a government minister said on Friday . 

With violence spiralling out of control , <LOC> France </LOC> voiced backing for the elected <LOC> Bangui </LOC> government but said its troops based in the former colony under defence pacts would not help it combat army mutineers . 

" <LOC> France </LOC> cannot be involved in the domestic political debate , " President <PER> Jacques Chirac </PER> told a news conference at the end of a <MISC> Franco-African </MISC> summit in <LOC> Burkina Faso </LOC> . 

" <MISC> French </MISC> troops may only take part in maintaining order to avoid major abuses and protect foreign communities , " he said . 

<MISC> Public </MISC> Service Minister <PER> David Dofara </PER> , who is the head of the national <ORG> Red Cross </ORG> , told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> he had seen the bodies of former interior minister <PER> Christophe Grelombe </PER> and his son , who was not named . 

Witnesses said they had been seized by troops loyal to President <PER> Ange-Felix Patasse </PER> at dawn on Thursday when they clashed with soldiers staging a mutiny since November 16 . 

<LOC> Grelombe </LOC> is from the <LOC> Yakoma </LOC> tribe to which most of the rebel soldiers belong . 

The uprising began over pay demands but has turned into a campaign to topple <LOC> Patasse </LOC> , sparking ethnic violence and dividing the capital . 

The former minister and his son had been taken from their home close to the presidential palace , which is guarded by loyalist soldiers backed by <MISC> French </MISC> troops based in <LOC> Bangui </LOC> . 

The bodies were found on Thursday in an open field about two km ( one mile ) further away , said <PER> Dofora </PER> and other witnesses . 

The men were seized as loyalist forces and <MISC> French </MISC> troops fought gunbattles with mutineers who fired rockets into the city centre . 

A <MISC> French-owned </MISC> hotel was slightly damaged . 

<LOC> Yakomas </LOC> are hounded in stronghold districts of <LOC> Patasse </LOC> 's <LOC> Baya </LOC> people while other tribes have fled areas in rebel hands . 

Roadblocks have been erected in city districts while central <LOC> Bangui </LOC> , which is patrolled by <MISC> French </MISC> troops with tanks , is deserted . 

Shops and businesses have remained shut this week . 

The <MISC> Franco-African </MISC> summit decided to send a mission <LOC> Bangui </LOC> to seek ways of containing the mutiny and a threat of civil war . 

<LOC> Chirac </LOC> said <LOC> Burkina </LOC> Faso President <PER> Blaise Compaore </PER> would visit <LOC> Bangui </LOC> " in the coming hours " with the heads of state of <LOC> Gabon </LOC> , <LOC> Mali </LOC> and <LOC> Chad </LOC> to try and establish dialogue between authorities and rebels . 

The mutiny forced <PER> Patasse </PER> to miss the summit . 

His spokesman had predicted the meeting to send an assessment mission . 

<PER> Patasse </PER> , who won <LOC> Central Africa </LOC> 's first multi-party elections , refuses to resign . 

<MISC> Church-led </MISC> meadiation attempts hit deadlock over rebel demands for his departure . 

Soldiers staged mutinies in April and May , with <MISC> French </MISC> troops stepping in with tanks and helicopters to quell the more serious second uprising . 

<PER> Patasse </PER> offered concessions and amnesty to rebels before the May rebellion ended after rebels looted the city centre . 

Rebels accuse <PER> Patasse </PER> of tribalism and of arming his civilian supporters and hired guns from <LOC> Sudan </LOC> and <LOC> Chad </LOC> . 

Mutineers have vowed to disarm all civilians and to chase out the foreign forces <LOC> knwon </LOC> as <PER> Codos </PER> . 

Hospital sources and witnesses said about 10 people were known to have been killed in the more than two weeks of fighting , including two rebels killed in Thursday 's clashes . 

An undetermined number of people are reported to have been abducted and killed outside the town by tribal vigilante groups . 

In Thursday 's fighting , <MISC> French </MISC> troops fired back as mutineers trying to break out of their strongholds rained mortar shells on the city centre .

A meeting with the <MISC> Pope </MISC> is also planned , " <PER> Dariusz Rosati </PER> told a news conference .

<LOC> Russia </LOC> warns <ORG> Norilsk </ORG> , not expected to liquidate it . 

<PER> Lynnley Browning </PER> 

<LOC> MOSCOW </LOC> 1996-12-06 

<MISC> Russian </MISC> Finance Minister <PER> Alexander Livshits </PER> warned financially-troubled <PER> Norilsk Nickel </PER> on Friday that it must pay overdue taxes , but analysts said the firm would not be liquidated or that its would assets would be frozen . 

" <ORG> Norilsk </ORG> really is a big debtor , both to the federal and regional budgets , " said <PER> Konstantin Chernyshev </PER> , equities analyst at <LOC> Moscow </LOC> brokerage <ORG> Rinaco Plus </ORG> and a <ORG> Norilsk </ORG> watcher . " 

Livshits 's words are an attempt to put pressure on the company . " 

The official <ORG> Itar-Tass </ORG> news agency quoted <ORG> Livshits </ORG> as telling parliamentary deputies that <ORG> RAO Norilsky Nikel 0#NKEL.RUO </ORG> had to pay its tax arrears and that bankruptcy procedures applied to the metals group . 

" If it was an unsolicited statement and a bolt out of the blue , then it obviously means something , " said <PER> Christopher Granville </PER> , chief economist at <LOC> United City Bank </LOC> in <LOC> Moscow </LOC> . 

" But if it was a response to a deputy 's question that was essentially loaded , then it was the only answer he could have given . " 

<MISC> Russian </MISC> tax and cabinet authorities , under pressure from the <ORG> International Monetary Fund </ORG> to boost tax revenues as a condition for receiving payments of a $ 10 billion , three-year loan to <LOC> Moscow </LOC> , have been striking fear into the hearts of some of <LOC> Russia </LOC> 's most prominent industrial firms by saying they must pay up or face liquidation . 

" They could freeze metal , but it 's not a long-term solution to the problem and would n't put money in the budget , " <PER> Chernyshev </PER> said . " 

I do n't think they would do that . " 

Entire social infrastructures in the icy <LOC> Far North </LOC> where <LOC> Norilsk </LOC> is based depend on the company , and <LOC> Moscow </LOC> has said it has no finances to resettle hundreds of thousands of people -- an expenditure which could far outstrip <ORG> Norilsk </ORG> 's debts . 

<ORG> Norilsk </ORG> officials declined to comment . 

Analysts said the government , while anxious about <ORG> Norilsk </ORG> 's debts , is highly unlikely to bring the nickel , copper , cobalt , platinum and platinum group metals producer to its knees or take measures that could significantly affect output . 

But it also wants <ORG> Norilsk </ORG> , the world 's second-largest nickel producer , to clean up its act . 

" The procedure of bankruptcy will be applied , " <ORG> Tass </ORG> quoted <PER> Livshits </PER> as telling <PER> Duma </PER> deputies about <PER> Norilsk </PER> . 

It indirectly quoted him as saying <PER> Norilsk </PER> should first pay salary arrears , which in the past have led to worker strikes . 

" It is unlikely that <ORG> Norilsk </ORG> will pay these debts in the near-term -- the company will remain a debtor in the near future , " <PER> Chernyshev </PER> said . 

He estimated the company 's regional debts at least one trillion roubles and said 30 percent of the giant <ORG> Krasnoyarsk </ORG> regional budget was fuelled by <PER> Norilsk </PER> money . 

<ORG> Norilsk </ORG> 's new majority shareholder , <MISC> Russian </MISC> commerical bank <ORG> Uneximbank </ORG> , has said it is reorganising metal exports through <ORG> Interrosimpex </ORG> in order to boost revenues . 

But the changes have yet to improve significantly <PER> Norilsk </PER> 's situation . 

" <PER> Uneximbank </PER> has inherited a mountain and whether or not they climb out and over it remains to be seen , " said one metals source . 

<ORG> Norilsk </ORG> said in September that it total debts , including unpaid salaries to workers , were 13 trillion roubles . 

The company said last month that it had worked out a tax payment schedule with authorities , after regional tax officials threatened to seize some nickel and copper assets .

Plastic surgery is booming , especially among men , as <MISC> Brazilians </MISC> spend much of their new-found wealth on the latest beauty treatments , said the organisers of a four-day international plastic surgery conference that opened on Friday . 

The number of plastic surgeries in <LOC> Brazil </LOC> has jumped 30 percent to an estimated 150,000 this year since an anti-inflation plan was introduced in July 1994 , <PER> Farid Hakme </PER> , the president of the <ORG> Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society </ORG> ( <ORG> SBCP </ORG> ) , said . 

The number of operations on men increased even more -- by 80 percent , from 8,000 in 1994 to 15,000 in 1995 , he said . 

" <LOC> Brazil </LOC> ranks right at the top for plastic surgery with respect to the number of surgeons , the number of patients , number of operations , number of conferences . 

Our statistics are the highest for everything , " <PER> Hakme </PER> said . 

" We believe the increase in plastic surgeries for men results from the difficulties in the job market . 

People need to have a more youthful look to compete in the job market , given the profound changes in <LOC> Latin America </LOC> 's economy . " 

A controlled exchange rate , trade liberalisation and tight monetary policies have also dramatically curbed inflation , making more money available for cosmetic surgery . 

<LOC> Brazil </LOC> has been at the forefront in plastic surgery for decades and is home to one of the most famous surgeons , <LOC> Ivo Pitangy </LOC> . 

There are 6,000 plastic surgeons there , of which 4,500 have qualified to be members of the <ORG> SBCP </ORG> . 

Every year , 500 new plastic surgeons graduate in <LOC> Brazil </LOC> and medical students from all over the world come to study there . 

Hakme attributes <LOC> Brazil </LOC> 's fascination with plastic surgery not to excessive vanity but to the country 's mix and match of different races , which can create physical disharmonies . " 

What happens is the nose sometimes does n't match the mouth or the buttocks do n't match with the legs , " he said . 

<LOC> Brazil </LOC> 's most sought-after beauty treatment is liposuction in which fat is sucked away from areas of the body , with about 30,000 operations a year at a cost of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 each . 

<MISC> Stomach </MISC> tucks and breast operations are also popular since the tropical climate calls for flesh-baring fashions , but unlike women elsewhere <MISC> Brazilians </MISC> tend to have breast reductions and buttock implants . 

" The women who want to reduce their breasts here would probably want to increase them in the <LOC> United States </LOC> , " <ORG> SBCP </ORG> Vice-President <PER> Oswaldo Saldanha </PER> said . " 

Beauty ideals and cultures are different in every country . " 

<PER> Plastic </PER> surgery scares like the case in which <MISC> Brazilian </MISC> model <PER> Claudia Liz </PER> fell into a coma after being anaesthetised for a liposuction in October are not much of a deterrent . 

<PER> Saldanha </PER> said operations fell 30 percent immediately after that case but the rate was back to normal now .

<LOC> Chile </LOC> and <LOC> Mexico </LOC> will start negotiations next year to broaden their free trade agreement to include services and investments , Finance Minister <PER> Eduardo Aninat </PER> said . 

<LOC> Chile </LOC> hopes to broaden the treaty signed in 1994 beyond reduction of tariffs on imports and exports and add provisions covering services and investment codes , said Aninat . 

Both areas tend to more laden with friction in free trade negotiations than tariff reduction .

<LOC> Indonesia </LOC> 's <PER> Belo </PER> leaves for <PER> Nobel </PER> award ceremony . 

<LOC> DILI </LOC> , <LOC> East Timor </LOC> 1996-12-06 

East Timorese <MISC> Roman Catholic </MISC> Bishop <PER> Carlos Belo </PER> left <LOC> Dili </LOC> on Friday on his way to Norway for the awards ceremony as co-recipient of the 1996 <MISC> Nobel Peace Prize </MISC> . 

Witnesses said <PER> Belo </PER> left the territory for the <MISC> Indonesian </MISC> capital <LOC> Jakarta </LOC> accompanied by five other people . 

It was not immediately known when he would arrive in <LOC> Oslo </LOC> . 

The bishop will jointly receive the <LOC> Nobel </LOC> award next Tuesday with <ORG> East Timorese-born </ORG> activist <PER> Jose Ramos Horta </PER> , who lives in self-exile in <LOC> Australia </LOC> . 

The <MISC> Indonesian </MISC> government has condemned the inclusion of <PER> Ramos Horta </PER> in the award , and Foreign Minister <PER> Ali Alatas </PER> said on Friday that <LOC> Indonesia </LOC> would not be represented officially at the ceremony in the <MISC> Norwegian </MISC> capital . 

" I sincerely believe that this unfortunate choice in giving the honour to such a controversial figure as <PER> Ramos Horta </PER> ... 

will exacerbate the problem in finding a solution ( to <LOC> East Timor </LOC> ) , " <PER> Alatas </PER> said on Friday . 

He was responding to questions at a news conference called to discuss next week 's ministerial meeting of the <ORG> Organisation of the Islamic Conference </ORG> ( <ORG> OIC </ORG> ) in <LOC> Jakarta </LOC> . 

<PER> Ramos Horta </PER> has been a vocal leader of the opposition to <LOC> Jakarta </LOC> 's rule in the territory . 

<LOC> Belo </LOC> and <PER> Ramos Horta </PER> were awared the prize for their efforts to secure a peaceful solution to the issue of <LOC> East Timor </LOC> , a former <MISC> Portuguese </MISC> colony which <LOC> Indonesia </LOC> invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year . 

The <ORG> United Nations </ORG> has never recognised <PER> Jakarta </PER> 's move . 

<PER> Alatas </PER> said the government 's position on the <ORG> Nobel Peace Prize </ORG> would have been different if it had been awarded solely to <PER> Belo </PER> . 

Asked if the <MISC> Indonesian </MISC> ambassador to <LOC> Norway </LOC> would have attended the ceremony if only <PER> Belo </PER> had been involved , <PER> Alatas </PER> replied : " Probably , yes , but that is a hypothetical question . " 

<PER> Alatas </PER> said on Tuesday that on his way back from <LOC> Oslo </LOC> , <PER> Belo </PER> would visit the <LOC> Vatican </LOC> to see the <LOC> Pope </LOC> , and would also meet <MISC> German </MISC> Chancellor <PER> Helmut Kohl </PER> in <LOC> Bonn </LOC> . 

<PER> Kohl </PER> had wanted to meet <PER> Belo </PER> during the chancellor 's official visit to <LOC> Indonesia </LOC> last month , but the bishop was too busy in <LOC> East Timor </LOC> to come to <LOC> Jakarta </LOC> .

Government disperses protest with water cannons . 

<LOC> RANGOON </LOC> 1996-12-07 

<MISC> Burmese </MISC> troops and riot police moved in to disperse a student street protest at a suburban road junction near the <LOC> Ranyon </LOC> ( <LOC> Rangoon </LOC> ) <ORG> University </ORG> early on Saturday , witnesses said . 

They said police and troops used water cannons from fire engines to subdue about 120 university students sitting in at the centre of the junction at about 3 a.m. before they moved in to round them up . 

The students , who had staged an 11-hour protest at the junction in northern <LOC> Rangoon </LOC> , were taken away in three vehicles . 

The witnesses said some of the students were hit with batons while they were herded onto the vehicles and it was believed they were taken to the <LOC> Insein </LOC> prison in suburban <LOC> Rangoon </LOC> . 

The protesting students , mostly from <ORG> Rangoon University </ORG> , were demanding the right to organise independent unions on campuses and the release of about 80 student leaders currently in jail . 

They were among 500 students who started demonstrating at the intersection on late Friday afternoon . 

The protest was the second major one in five days in the capital .

Burmese students march briefly out of campus . 

<PER> Vithoon Amorn </PER> 

<LOC> RANGOON </LOC> 1996-12-06 

About 200 <MISC> Burmese </MISC> students marched briefly from troubled <ORG> Yangon Institute </ORG> of <LOC> Technology </LOC> in northern <LOC> Rangoon </LOC> on Friday towards the <ORG> University of Yangon </ORG> six km ( four miles ) away , and returned to their campus , witnesses said . 

Seven truckloads of armed riot police and three fire engines were on standby at one of the junctions near the institute . 

There were no clashes . 

" They are now back in the <ORG> YIT </ORG> campus , " an institute official who declined to be identified told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> by telephone . 

One of two roads leading to the <ORG> University of Yangon </ORG> from the institute had been closed by authorities . 

But about 300 university students were still gathered outside the gates of their campus , witnesses said . 

They were singing peacefully . 

On Monday and Tuesday , students from the institute and the university launched protests against what they said was unfair handling by police of a brawl between some of their colleagues and restaurant owners in October . 

On Tuesday and Wednesday , opposition leader <PER> Aung San Suu Kyi </PER> was restricted to her home by the military government to prevent her from being drawn into the protests . 

She was allowed to move freely on Thursday . 

The protest culminated at dawn on Tuesday with several hundred students being detained briefly by police in central <LOC> Rangoon </LOC> . 

The street protests were the biggest seen in the capital since the student-led pro-democracry demonstrations of September 1988 when the junta crushed the uprising . 

Thousands were killed or imprisoned . 

Earlier on Friday some of the students , who were held briefly by police during the protests earlier this week , said they were still dissatisfied with the military government . 

They told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> they were unhappy that the ruling <ORG> State Law and Order Restoration Council </ORG> ( <ORG> SLORC </ORG> ) had not heeded their calls for the right to organise independent unions on campus . 

" We still want government answers to our demands . 

We want police punishment to be published in newspapers , " one student said . 

But the students stressed their protests were non-political and they had no contact with <LOC> Suu Kyi </LOC> 's <ORG> National League for Democracy </ORG> ( <ORG> NLD </ORG> ) . 

<PER> Suu Kyi </PER> , a <LOC> Nobel </LOC> laureate and daughter of independence hero <PER> Aung San </PER> , and key <ORG> NLD </ORG> officials have also denied any link with the students . 

But they have said both parties had a " moral link " in that they were against police brutality and injustice . 

The students also demanded the government announce punishments meted out to policemen who they said had manhandled students involved in a brawl with some restaurant owners near the <LOC> Yangon </LOC> institute in October . 

The students appealed to the government not to close the institute because of their latest demonstration . 

The institute was shut for nearly two years after the 1988 uprising . 

On Friday , the road leading to <LOC> Suu Kyi </LOC> 's lakeside residence in central <LOC> Rangoon </LOC> remained closed by police .

Union leaders outraged by <ORG> WTO </ORG> snub to <ORG> ILO </ORG> head . 

<LOC> SINGAPORE </LOC> 1996-12-06 

International trade union leaders on Friday expressed outrage that the head of the <ORG> International Labour Organisation </ORG> ( <ORG> ILO </ORG> ) had been barred from speaking at next week 's <ORG> WTO </ORG> meeting in <LOC> Singapore </LOC> . 

<PER> Bill Jordan </PER> , general secretary of the <ORG> International Confederation of Free Trade Unions </ORG> ( <ORG> ICFTU </ORG> ) , told a news conference the withdrawal of a <ORG> WTO </ORG> invitation to <ORG> ILO </ORG> director general <PER> Michel Hansenne </PER> was " outrageous behaviour on the part of an organisation that wants to command respect in the world " . 

<LOC> Jordan </LOC> said a small group of developing nations that oppose linking trade talks and labour conditions had pressured <ORG> World Trade Organisation </ORG> ( <ORG> WTO </ORG> ) officials to prevent <LOC> Hansenne </LOC> from taking the platform to urge such links . 

" It is to their shame that those who are responsible for encouraging this meeting responded ( to the pressure ) in silencing him , " <PER> Jordan </PER> said after the opening of an <ORG> ICFTU </ORG> conference on international labour standards and trade . 

The three-day trade union conference in <LOC> Singapore </LOC> hopes to push labour issues onto the <ORG> WTO </ORG> agenda . 

<PER> Jordan </PER> said the <ORG> WTO </ORG> 's credibility was at stake over the issue of trade and labour . 

The <ORG> ICFTU </ORG> said it wanted the <ORG> WTO </ORG> conference beginning on Monday to outlaw forced and child labour , end discrimination in hiring , and guarantee the right to join a union . 

<PER> Bill Brett </PER> , chairman of the <ORG> ILO Workers Group </ORG> , told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> before the news conference he was " not too surprised , but very disappointed " that the speaking invitation had been withdrawn . 

" Some governments are very determined to stop the issue ( of trade and labour rights ) being discussed , " he said , adding that the <ORG> Association of Southeast Asian Nations </ORG> ( <ORG> ASEAN </ORG> ) seemed particularly hostile to the <ORG> ILO </ORG> agenda . 

<ORG> ASEAN </ORG> groups <LOC> Brunei </LOC> , <LOC> Indonesia </LOC> , <LOC> Malaysia </LOC> , the <LOC> Philippines </LOC> , <LOC> Singapore </LOC> , <LOC> Thailand </LOC> and <LOC> Vietnam </LOC> . 

The <ORG> ILO </ORG> wants a trade and labour rights " social clause " included in the final ministerial statement issued by <ORG> WTO </ORG> leaders at the end of the meeting , the organization 's first ministerial-level gathering . 

Speaking to <ORG> ICFTU </ORG> delegates , <PER> Richard Eglin </PER> , director of the <ORG> WTO </ORG> secretariat , said the <ORG> WTO </ORG> was capable of making a significant contribution to governmental efforts to solve social problems . 

But he said the <ORG> WTO </ORG> 's organisational structure made it difficult to impose on its members a social clause such as that called for by the <ORG> ILO </ORG> .

<MISC> Indian </MISC> rubber demand seen outstripping production . 

<LOC> SINGAPORE </LOC> 1996-12-06 

<MISC> Indian </MISC> rubber demand is seen outpacing local production in the 1996/97 April / March season and the trend will persist way into the next century , the chairman of the <ORG> Rubber Board of India </ORG> said on Friday . 

<PER> K.J. Matthew </PER> said at the <ORG> Asia Rubber Markets </ORG> meeting here <MISC> Indian </MISC> production of natural rubber in 1996/97 will reach 547,000 tonnes against projected demand of 578,000 tonnes , a gap of 31,000 tonnes . 

For synthetic rubber , production reached 68,200 tonnes in 1995/96 while consumption in the same season hit 134,085 tonnes , <PER> Matthew </PER> added . 

" Though schemes designed to realise further increases in the production of natural rubber are being operated successfully , the demand-supply gap is expected to widen , " he said . 

<MISC> Indian </MISC> synthetic rubber output is not expected to rise significantly in the next season but demand will rise to 145,000 tonnes . 

Matthew estimates that by the 2000/01 season , the gap between natural rubber output and consumption will rise to 51,000 tonnes and 319,000 tonnes in 2010/11 . 

Natural rubber production will go up to 695,000 tonnes in 2000/01 against consumption of 746,000 tonnes . 

In 2010/11 , domestic demand should rise further to 1.233 million tonnes while production will only reach about 914,000 tonnes . 

One way to bridge the widening gap is to put more land under cultivation which the <LOC> Rubber Board </LOC> official estimates will reach 220,000 hectares between now and the year 2003 although <PER> Matthew </PER> said this may not be possible at this time in <LOC> India </LOC> . 

" The development objective for the rubber plantation industry will be to increase production to the best extent possibly with a view to minimising imports of natural rubber , " he said .

<LOC> Japan </LOC> 's authorities seen seeking to rein in dollar . 

<PER> George Nishiyama </PER> 

<LOC> TOKYO </LOC> 1996-12-06 

Comments by <LOC> Japan </LOC> 's tight-lipped central bank chief and an influential top bureaucrat are further signs that the nation 's authorities want to keep the dollar at current levels , market sources said on Friday . 

In a rare expression of a view on currencies by the <ORG> Bank of Japan </ORG> ( <ORG> BOJ </ORG> ) governor , <PER> Yasuo Matsushita </PER> was quoted in <LOC> Japan </LOC> 's leading economic daily on Friday as saying that he sees no further , immediate fall in the yen . 

This followed a widely watched television appearance late on Thursday by <PER> Eisuke Sakakibara </PER> , a high-ranking <ORG> Finance Ministry </ORG> official , who denied he had said he wants to guide the dollar lower to between 108 and 110 yen . 

But many in the market thought <LOC> Sakakibara </LOC> 's real intentions lay elsewhere , and took more notice of his comments about the <LOC> U.S. </LOC> government 's stance on the dollar , dealers said . 

" I think his views on ( <ORG> U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert </ORG> ) <PER> Rubin </PER> 's comments were indeed what he himself thinks about the dollar , " said <PER> Hank Note </PER> , chief dealer at <ORG> Sumitomo Bank </ORG> . 

Asked about <PER> Rubin </PER> 's comment that a strong dollar was in <LOC> U.S. </LOC> interests , <LOC> Sakakibara </LOC> said the remark does not necessarily mean the <LOC> United States </LOC> supports a stronger dollar . 

" It 's a strong dollar , not stronger . 

In that sense , the comments are not pointing to a certain direction , " he said . 

" It shows that <PER> Sakakibara </PER> is not for a stronger dollar either , " said <PER> Sumitomo </PER> 's <PER> Note </PER> . 

<PER> Takao Sakoh </PER> , first vice president at <ORG> Union Bank of Switzerland </ORG> in <LOC> Tokyo </LOC> , said : " Maybe a dollar at 104.50 yen is not acceptable ( to <LOC> Sakakibara </LOC> ) , but it may be okay at the current level , at the lower end of 112 yen . " 

Market participants have kept a close eye on <LOC> Sakakibara </LOC> , chief of the ministry 's <ORG> International Finance Bureau </ORG> , as a comment he made in November after the dollar hit this year 's high of 114.92 yen pushed the currency down sharply . 

He had said then that the market 's view on <LOC> Japan </LOC> 's economy was too pessimistic and that he believed it was stronger than the market thought . 

Dealers have come to refer to 115 yen as the " <LOC> Sakakibara </LOC> ceiling " for the dollar following the remark . 

Adding to the comments by " Mr Yen " , as <PER> Sakakibara </PER> is known for his prominence in the currency market , was <ORG> BOJ </ORG> governor <PER> Matsushita </PER> 's remark . 

" The recent level of the yen exchange rate has been stable , and it does not appear to be moving towards a further depreciation of the yen immediately , so import prices are likely to stabilise at current levels , " <PER> Matsushita </PER> said in an interview with the <ORG> Nihon Keizai Shimbun </ORG> . 

" The fact that he touched on the issue of inflation triggered by import prices shows that the <ORG> BOJ </ORG> does not want a further depreciation of the yen , past 115 yen , " said <PER> Yasuhito Kawashima </PER> , chief forex manager at <ORG> Toyo Trust & Banking Co </ORG> . 

<PER> Some </PER> said the central bank may have been concerned a weaker yen would lead to unfounded pessimism about <LOC> Japan </LOC> 's economy . 

" There was concern that foreign investors may sell <MISC> Japanese </MISC> stocks if the dollar goes above 115 yen . 

The <ORG> BOJ </ORG> does not want the yen 's weakness to lead to pessimism over the economy , " said <PER> Taisuke Tanaka </PER> , market strategist with <PER> Credit Suisse </PER> in <LOC> Tokyo </LOC> . 

Senior <ORG> BOJ </ORG> officials have separately said financial markets ' views on the economy have been too negative . 

" I realise there are negative views in the markets about the impact of the consumption tax hike and drop in public spending , but the markets appear to be exaggerating the magnitude of the negative impact , " a senior <ORG> BOJ </ORG> official told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> on Friday . 

The consumption tax is due to raised in April from three to five percent .

<LOC> Lebanon </LOC> sentences <MISC> pro-Israeli </MISC> warlord to death . 

<PER> Haitham Haddadin </PER> 

<LOC> BEIRUT </LOC> 1996-12-06 

A <MISC> Lebanese </MISC> military court on Friday sentenced to death in absentia the commander of <LOC> Israel </LOC> 's surrogate militia in south <LOC> Lebanon </LOC> on treason charges . 

The court convicted General <PER> Antoine Lahd </PER> , head of the <ORG> South Lebanon Army </ORG> ( <ORG> SLA </ORG> ) , of collaborating with <LOC> Israel </LOC> with which <LOC> Lebanon </LOC> is officially at war . 

<PER> Lahd </PER> , a 69-year-old former <MISC> Lebanese </MISC> army major-general , heads the 3,000-strong <ORG> SLA </ORG> militia which helps <LOC> Israel </LOC> hold a border zone in south <LOC> Lebanon </LOC> to ward off cross-frontier guerrilla raids on northern <LOC> Israel </LOC> . 

<PER> Lahd </PER> said a few days after the trial began on February 16 that <MISC> Lebanese </MISC> authorities must drop the charges or risk blocking any peace deal with the <MISC> Jewish </MISC> state . 

He said <PER> Israel </PER> was capable of pressuring <LOC> Lebanon </LOC> 's <MISC> Syrian-backed </MISC> government to stop the legal pursuit . 

The charges against <LOC> Lahd </LOC> were : forming a hostile army , carrying weapons on <LOC> Israel </LOC> 's side , helping <LOC> Israel </LOC> strip off a part of <MISC> Lebanese </MISC> territory by violence , forming an armed gang , killing or trying to kill <MISC> Lebanese </MISC> civilians by artillery shelling and kidnapping <MISC> Lebanese </MISC> citizens for long periods . 

<PER> Shortly </PER> before <PER> Lahd </PER> 's trial began , a <LOC> Beirut </LOC> military prosecutor charged another 89 former <MISC> Lebanese </MISC> army soldiers with collaborating with <LOC> Israel </LOC> . 

No date has been set for the trial of the men , all members of the <MISC> SLA </MISC> living in the <MISC> Israeli-held </MISC> zone in south <LOC> Lebanon </LOC> . 

<LOC> Israel </LOC> and <LOC> Lahd </LOC> have repeatedly demanded safety guarantees for the <MISC> SLA </MISC> -- a mixed <MISC> Christian-Shi'ite </MISC> <ORG> Moslem </ORG> force -- which the <MISC> Jewish </MISC> states regards as loyal allies . 

<LOC> Israel </LOC> has said the <MISC> Lebanese </MISC> army must incorporate the <ORG> SLA </ORG> fighters into its ranks as an army brigade as a condition for peace . 

But <MISC> Lebanese </MISC> political analysts have said that would be out of the question and <MISC> Lebanese </MISC> authorities pre-empted the issue by taking legal action against <PER> Lahd </PER> . 

Former <MISC> Israeli </MISC> Prime Minister <PER> Shimon Peres </PER> , calling <PER> Lahd </PER> " a great <MISC> Lebanese </MISC> patriot " , said earlier this year <PER> Lebanon </PER> had insulted the <ORG> SLA </ORG> commander by ordering his arrest on the treason charges . 

<PER> Peres </PER> , who was ousted in May by rightwing <MISC> Israeli </MISC> leader <PER> Benjamin Netanyahu </PER> , said there could not be real negotiations with <LOC> Lebanon </LOC> " unless it will stop the maltreatment of the <ORG> SLA </ORG> and its commanders . " 

The <LOC> Beirut </LOC> military court also sentenced to life in jail in absentia <LOC> Etian Saqr </LOC> , former head of the <ORG> pro-Israeli Guardians of the Cedars </ORG> , a small rightwing <MISC> Christian </MISC> civil war militia . 

<PER> Saqr </PER> , whose trial was concurrent with <PER> Lahd </PER> 's , was convicted of " contacting the <MISC> Israeli </MISC> enemy , passing information to <LOC> Israel </LOC> and undertaking hostile acts against <LOC> Lebanon </LOC> " .

<PER> Fourteen </PER> years after he bludgeoned and shot a man whose trailer home he robbed in 1982 , <PER> John Mills Jr </PER> . 

, 41 , was put to death in <LOC> Florida </LOC> 's electric chair Friday . 

As <PER> Glenn Lawhon </PER> , a rural <LOC> Florida </LOC> minister who is the victim 's father , looked on , <PER> Mills </PER> was pronounced dead at 7:13 a.m. EST ( 1213 <MISC> GMT </MISC> ) for the murder of <PER> Lester Lawhon </PER> . 

Speaking in <LOC> Arabic </LOC> , <PER> Mills </PER> made a final statement before an anonymous citizen flipped the switch that sent 2000 volts of electricity through his body , said <ORG> Department of Corrections </ORG> spokesman <PER> Eugene Morris </PER> , who was present at the execution . 

" I bear witness that there is no <PER> God </PER> but <PER> Allah </PER> and I bear witness that the prophet <PER> Mohammed </PER> is the messenger of <PER> God </PER> , " he quoted <PER> Mills </PER> as saying . 

<MISC> Prison </MISC> officials said they had no record of <PER> Mills </PER> ' official conversion , but they said that , on May 14 , 1991 , he had asked that a new name , <PER> Yuhanna Abdullah Muhammed </PER> , be added to his prison file , which is usually an indication of a conversion to <LOC> Islam </LOC> . 

<PER> Mills </PER> is the 38th person to die in <LOC> Florida </LOC> 's electric chair since the <ORG> U.S. Supreme Court </ORG> reversed itself in 1976 and legalised the death penalty .

He spent Thursday with family members and his spiritual adviser , <PER> Morris </PER> said . 

<PER> Mills </PER> was scheduled to die Wednesday but had his sentence temporarily postponed by the <ORG> Florida Supreme Court </ORG> . 

On Thursday , the 11th <ORG> Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals </ORG> in <LOC> Atlanta </LOC> denied his appeal in federal court .

<PER> Lester Lawhon </PER> was taken to a nearby airstrip where he was bludgeoned with a tire iron . 

<PER> Mills </PER> then fired two shots that killed <PER> Lawhon </PER> as the victim tried to run away .

Man stole pigs , tipped strippers , gets 10 years . 

<LOC> APPLETON </LOC> , <LOC> Wis </LOC> . 

1996-12-06 

A farmhand used the proceeds from stolen pigs to lavish tips on dancers at strip clubs and offered one $ 3,000 to pay for breast implant surgery , authorities said Friday . 

In sentencing <PER> Darrel Voeks </PER> , 38 , to a 10-year prison term on Thursday , Outagmie County Circuit Court Judge <PER> Dennis Luebke </PER> said he was " a thief by habit . " 

" You are self-indulgent . 

You are narcissitic , " <PER> Luebke </PER> said at the sentencing , adding <PER> Voeks </PER> should pay restitution of more than $ 100,000 to the farming family who had hired him . 

<PER> Voeks </PER> , who was already on probation for prior pig thefts , pleaded that he was trying to pay bills for his ex-wife and children . 

But the court heard that receipts showed much of the money went to dancers at strip clubs where he was known as a big tipper . 

One stripper said <PER> Voeks </PER> offered to give her $ 3,000 for breast implant surgery .

Half of dog bites provoked , says <MISC> American </MISC> vet . 

<LOC> CHICAGO </LOC> 1996-12-06 

As many as 1 million dog bites are recorded in the <LOC> United States </LOC> every year and half of them are provoked by humans , a veterinarian told fellow animal doctors on Friday . 

The <ORG> Humane Society </ORG> of the <LOC> United States </LOC> estimates that between 500,000 and one million bites are delivered by dogs each year , more than half of which are suffered by children . 

" Most bites can be prevented by teaching children how to respect a dog , " <PER> Michael Cornwell </PER> of the <ORG> Glencoe Animal Hospital </ORG> in <LOC> Columbus </LOC> , <LOC> Ohio </LOC> , told the annual meeting of the <ORG> American Veterinary Medical Association </ORG> . 

" Let 's not let our kids jump on them or crawl on them . 

Dogs and children do n't have to have an interaction . 

Let 's respect their territories , " he said . 

<PER> Cornwell </PER> said 50 percent of reported bites were provoked by a person and 60 percent were suffered by children . 

He also estimated that only 25 percent of bites were reported because medical attention was not needed . 

<PER> Don Rieck </PER> , president of the <ORG> National Animal Control Association </ORG> , said aggressiveness in dogs was related more to gender than breed and a male dog that had not been neutered was three times more likely to bite than an unspayed female . 

The five breeds credited with the most incidents were chow chows , <ORG> Rottweilers </ORG> , <MISC> German </MISC> shepherds , cocker spaniels and <MISC> Dalmatians </MISC> . " 

The trends in dog bites by particular breeds have more to do with fad pets owned by individuals who need to have something unique . 

Speaking strictly of dogs , 15 years ago the macho fad pet was a <MISC> Doberman </MISC> . 

Today , <ORG> Rottweilers </ORG> are on the way up , " <PER> Rieck </PER> said . 

If approached by a stray dog , children should be taught to stand still with fists folded underneath the neck , elbows in , and gaze forward until the dog goes away .

<ORG> Four Africans </ORG> said to vie for top <LOC> U.N. </LOC> post . 

<PER> Evelyn Leopold </PER> 

<ORG> UNITED NATIONS </ORG> 1996-12-06 

Four <MISC> African </MISC> states are ready to nominate candidates for the post of <ORG> U.N. </ORG> secretary-general on Friday now that <PER> Boutros Boutros-Ghali </PER> has temporarily put aside his bid for re-election . 

The nominees , according to diplomats , are : <PER> Kofi Annan </PER> of <LOC> Ghana </LOC> , the <LOC> U.N. </LOC> undersecretary-general for peacekeeping ; <PER> Ahmedou Ould Abdallah </PER> of <LOC> Mauritania </LOC> , the former <ORG> U.N. </ORG> special envoy for <LOC> Burundi </LOC> ; <PER> Amara Essy </PER> of the <LOC> Ivory Coast </LOC> , its foreign minister and the <ORG> U.N. General Assembly </ORG> president in 1994-95 ; and <PER> Hamid Algabid </PER> of <LOC> Niger </LOC> , the secretary-general of the <ORG> Organisation of the Islamic Conference </ORG> . 

Representatives of the <ORG> U.N. </ORG> missions of <LOC> Ghana </LOC> , the <LOC> Ivory Coast </LOC> , <LOC> Mauritania </LOC> and <LOC> Niger </LOC> have scheduled a meeting with <ORG> Security Council </ORG> president <PER> Paolo Fulci </PER> of <LOC> Italy </LOC> to hand in the nominations in writing , the envoys said . 

It was not known if other candidates would step forward . 

Diplomats said General <PER> Joseph Garba </PER> of <LOC> Nigeria </LOC> , a <ORG> U.N. General Assembly </ORG> president in 1989-90 , was putting forth his own candidacy without being nominated by his country . 

<PER> Boutros-Ghali </PER> on Wednesday opened the door for other <MISC> Africans </MISC> to contest his job by saying he was suspending temporarily his candidacy but was not withdrawing completely from the race . 

His supporters said this meant he remained a candidate in case the race reached an impasse . 

The <LOC> United States </LOC> on Nov. 19 vetoed his bid for re-election while the other 14 <ORG> Security Council </ORG> members supported him . 

The move by the <MISC> African </MISC> states means that the council could begin voting on candidates next week , a procedure that could either result in a decision or turn into a bitter fight with vetoes against each nominee . 

The <ORG> Security Council </ORG> has to vote on a new secretary-general and then seek the endorsement of the 185-members <ORG> General Assembly </ORG> before December 31 when <PER> Boutros-Ghali </PER> 's term expires .

<PER> Alessandra Mussolini </PER> , the granddaughter of <LOC> Italy </LOC> 's Fascist dictator <PER> Benito Mussolini </PER> , said on Friday she had rejoined the far-right <ORG> National Alliance </ORG> ( <ORG> AN </ORG> ) party she quit over policy differences last month . 

" I 've gone back , " she told a radio show shortly after <ORG> AN </ORG> leader <PER> Gianfranco Fini </PER> , who was being interviewed on the programme , said the row had been resolved . 

" He did n't want to lose me and I did n't want to lose him . " 

<PER> Fini </PER> told state radio <ORG> RAI </ORG> he met <PER> Mussolini </PER> thanks to the good offices of <ORG> Giuseppe Tatarella </ORG> , <ORG> AN </ORG> 's leader in the <ORG> Chamber of Deputies </ORG> ( lower house ) , and had overcome their differences . 

<PER> Mussolini </PER> , 33 , resigned from the parliamentary party group for what she said were strictly political reasons . 

The fiery politician , who is also a niece of screen star <PER> Sophia Loren </PER> , had accused <ORG> AN </ORG> leaders of stifling internal party debate . 

<PER> Mussolini </PER> , who sits in the <LOC> Chamber </LOC> , told <ORG> La Stampa </ORG> newspaper last month after quitting <ORG> AN </ORG> 's parliamentary party that she was considering joining the neo-fascist <ORG> Social Movement </ORG> ( <ORG> MS-Fiamma </ORG> ) formed by some of the <MISC> Duce 's World War Two </MISC> followers .

The <ORG> European Union </ORG> and <LOC> Poland </LOC> have resolved disagreements over a new <MISC> Polish </MISC> oil import regime , the <ORG> European Commission </ORG> said on Friday . 

The <ORG> EU </ORG> had objected to increases in <MISC> Polish </MISC> tariffs on imports of gasoline and gasoil products introduced on January 1 , 1996 , saying they contravened levels envisaged in the so-called <ORG> Europe Agreement </ORG> between the <ORG> EU </ORG> and <LOC> Poland </LOC> . 

The increases were aimed at protecting the <MISC> Polish </MISC> market while helping to modernise the local oil industry .

Under the agreement , <LOC> Poland </LOC> will abolish all oil import tariffs by 2001 , remove all oil price controls and end quantitative restrictions on imports by January 1 , 1997 . 

The agreement includes the early privatisation and modernisation of <MISC> Polish </MISC> oil refineries , which will be obliged to offer equal treatment to all buyers .

<MISC> Hindu </MISC> nationalists forced adjournment of <LOC> India </LOC> 's lower house of parliament on Friday , in protest against a proposal to observe a minute 's silence over the destruction of a mosque by a <MISC> Hindu </MISC> mob in 1992 . 

Members of the <MISC> Hindu </MISC> nationalist <PER> Bharatiya Janata Party </PER> ( <ORG> BJP </ORG> ) shouted <MISC> pro-Hindu </MISC> slogans in the house after a communist deputy made the proposal in remembrance of the <LOC> Babri </LOC> mosque , which was razed on December 6 , 1992 . 

The house was first adjourned for two hours . 

When it reconvened , <ORG> BJP </ORG> deputies resumed the slogan-shouting , and deputy speaker <PER> Suraj Bhan </PER> suspended work until Monday . 

The destruction of the 16th-century mosque in the northern <MISC> Indian </MISC> town of <LOC> Ayodhya </LOC> triggered nationwide <MISC> Hindu-Moslem </MISC> violence in which more than 3,000 people were killed . 

<MISC> Indian </MISC> officials blame revenge-minded <MISC> Moslem </MISC> underworld gangs in Bombay for a string of bombings in the city three months later that killed 260 people .

<PER> Snow </PER> said the plane last reported to air traffic control at about 3 <LOC> A.M. </LOC> local time / 1:30 A.M. EST ( 0630 <MISC> GMT </MISC> ) when it began its final approach about 10 miles ( 16 km ) from the airport in this east coast <MISC> Canadian </MISC> province .

" President <PER> Arafat </PER> is ready to meet Prime <PER> Minister Netanyahu </PER> but no time or date has been set for such a meeting yet . 

" President <PER> Arafat </PER> 's position is clear that such a meeting should come after successful negotiations so that the meeting would have positive results .

<PER> Both Arafat </PER> and <LOC> Netanyahu </LOC> have expressed willingness to meet . 

They last met in <LOC> Washington </LOC> after clashes in September that killed 60 <MISC> Palestinians </MISC> and 15 <MISC> Israelis </MISC> .

<LOC> Turkey </LOC> 's efforts to prevent <MISC> Kurdish </MISC> rebels and smugglers infiltrating from <LOC> Syria </LOC> are being badly hindered because the military does not have a map of its own minefields on the border , a commission of parliamentarians said .

The <LOC> United States </LOC> Thursday blasted the release from a <LOC> Greek </LOC> prison of a <MISC> Palestinian </MISC> guerrilla convicted of bombing an airliner and killing a teenager in 1982 , saying the move " does not make sense . "

We ca n't let terrorists out of jail when they are a danger to civilians all around the world , " <ORG> State Department </ORG> spokesman <PER> Nicholas Burns </PER> said . '

It is inexplicable to us why he would have been allowed to leave <LOC> Greece </LOC> before serving his just sentence ... <PER> This </PER> is an incomprehensible move . 

It does not make sense , " <PER> Burns </PER> told a news briefing .

The <PER> Clinton </PER> administration 's strong views on this subject have been conveyed to the <MISC> Greek </MISC> government , <PER> Burns </PER> said . 

<PER> Mahammad Rashid </PER> was whisked from <LOC> Korydallos </LOC> maximum security prison just outside <LOC> Athens </LOC> to the airport where he boarded a regular <ORG> Olympic Airways </ORG> flight to <LOC> Cairo </LOC> where he would transit to <LOC> Tunis </LOC> and the former <ORG> Palestine Liberation Organisation </ORG> headquarters . 

<PER> Rashid </PER> , 46 , was sentenced to 18 years in prison by a <LOC> Greek </LOC> court in 1992 after being convicted of premeditated murder in the mid-air bombing of a <MISC> Pan American </MISC> airliner in 1982 . 

His sentence had been reduced to 15 years in 1993 .

Cyberspace squabbles overshadow copyright talks . 

<PER> Elif Kaban </PER> 

<LOC> GENEVA </LOC> 1996-12-06 

In a gloomy <ORG> Geneva </ORG> conference centre built before the dawn of the <ORG> Internet </ORG> , groups of staid officials made a first stab on Friday at rewriting copyright laws for the digital age . 

But critics at the first government-level meeting to revise copyright laws in 25 years said the officials and legislators might as well be trying to police the ether . 

After four days of diplomatic wrangling over procedures , some 600 delegates from nations small and large got down to the nitty-gritty of setting the digital agenda for the first time . 

Cyberspace squabbles overshadowed the debate on a stack of proposals covering literary and artistic works , the rights of performers and producers of music and producers of databases . 

" If it goes on like this , we wo n't have enough time to finish all the discussions , " a frustrated <MISC> Western </MISC> delegate said . " 

They announced they will start evening sessions next week . " 

Attempts by copyright-based industries to ensure they get a cut from online works led to a storm of protests by <ORG> Internet </ORG> companies and critics who say the pacts would curb public access to online information from soccer results to stock prices . 

" It 's not illegal to make photocopies of newspaper articles . 

It 's fair use . 

We can read sports statistics or stock prices . 

But with the treaty , this kind of fact will be owned and subject to licensing , " said <PER> James Love </PER> , a consumer lobbyist heading the <ORG> Washington-based Consumer Project </ORG> on <LOC> Technology </LOC> . 

" None of the treaties are ready to move . 

These people do n't understand what they 're doing . " 

At stake are billions of dollars and the future of the electronic information industry -- the coming medium for the distribution of music , films , literature , software and commerce . 

Supporters of the three pacts say they are only an extension of existing intellectual property rights , covered by the century-old <ORG> Berne Convention </ORG> . 

But an array of opponents from the network industry to consumer , scientific and academic groups say the pacts will give sweeping powers to entertainment and copyright-based industries . 

A quick survey at the conference centre found few officials who had actually surfed the <ORG> Internet </ORG> . 

<LOC> Mongolia </LOC> 's state copyright official , <PER> Gundegma Jargalshaihan </PER> , said apologetically that he had just arrived from <LOC> Ulan Bator </LOC> and was not aware of the details of the digital agenda . 

" We do n't have money for <LOC> Internet </LOC> in <LOC> Mongolia </LOC> , " he added . 

<PER> Alexander Bavykin </PER> , deputy legal chief at <LOC> Russia </LOC> 's foreign ministry , said <PER> Moscow </PER> had yet to formulate a policy on copyright in cybersppace . 

He too had never browsed the Net . 

" I 've never tried it and why should I ? 

There are lots of other things in this life I have n't tried either , " he said . 

A visit to the computer centre offering <ORG> Internet </ORG> services found a lone <MISC> European </MISC> official clicking away on his mouse . 

" Internet is a potential cash cow for copyright-based industries and we need roadmaps on the information superhighway , " said <PER> Marc Pearl </PER> , vice-president of the <ORG> Information Technology Association of America </ORG> , a trade association of <LOC> U.S. </LOC> network companies opposing the treaties . 

" But there are a lot of dinosaurs here . 

People here do n't understand <ORG> Internet </ORG> technology . 

Because they do n't understand technology , they fear the unknown . " 

Before the <ORG> Internet </ORG> , those whose business was to protect copyrights knew where they stood . 

Their enemies were tangible if elusive , such as the people who pirated music cassettes . 

But the <ORG> Internet </ORG> , a global computer network where anything from music to software can be duplicated and distributed at the click of a computer mouse , has ripped up the rulebooks . 

<ORG> Network </ORG> operators said the draft laws would hold them responsible for copyright infringements in the system and expose them to multi-billion-dollar liabilities . 

" There are 500 million messages transmitted through the <MISC> Internet </MISC> everyday , " said <PER> Tim Casey </PER> of the <ORG> U.S.-based MCI Communications Corporation </ORG> . " 

How can we control them all ? "

<MISC> Italian </MISC> President Oscar <PER> Luigi Scalfaro </PER> visited the symbolic heartland of the separatist <LOC> Northern League </LOC> on Friday and appealed to its supporters to drop their campaign for a breakaway state .

" <LOC> Help Italy </LOC> to teach , to propose a capacity for strong local autonomy , for the federalism which can give new vigour to our blood .

Court ejects head of <MISC> Australian </MISC> child-sex inquiry . 

<LOC> CANBERRA </LOC> 1996-12-06 

The <MISC> Australian </MISC> opposition on Friday demanded a high-powered investigation into paedophilia in the <MISC> Australian </MISC> diplomatic service after the federal court forced the head of the existing inquiry to stand aside . 

The court said inquiry head <PER> Chris Hunt </PER> might be biased , since he privately told a newspaper he had turned up no major evidence of paedophile activity , even though he still had months ' of investigation before him . 

" Today we are left with a ruinous wreck beyond salvage and a continuing pall of doubt and suspicion hanging over our diplomatic service , " opposition foreign affairs spokesman <PER> Laurie Brereton </PER> said . 

But the government responded by pressing ahead with the original inquiry , established in May , appointing a new head to lead it . 

Critics say that if there were many paedophiles in senior posts in the <ORG> Foreign Affairs Department </ORG> then a secret inquiry would be open to internal influence and would become a public service whitewash . 

Accordingly , they demand an open investigation . 

A spokesman for Foreign Affairs Minister <PER> Alexander Downer </PER> said the appointment of a new inquiry head , administrative law expert <PER> Pamela O'Neil </PER> , showed the government 's commitment to pursue the matter . 

A report is due in May next year .

<LOC> Japan </LOC> 's <ORG> Economic Planning Agency </ORG> has not changed its view that the economy is gradually recovering , despite relatively weak gross domestic product figures released on Tuesday , <ORG> EPA </ORG> Vice Minister <PER> Shimpei Nukaya </PER> told reporters on Friday . 

He said the <ORG> GDP </ORG> growth was weak but that this reflected the economy between July and September and did not take into account more recent data . 

When asked about the outlook for the fiscal year beginning in April , <PER> Nukaya </PER> said the economy may slow down in the early part of the fiscal year due to a planned consumption tax hike , but that would be only temporary . 

The consumption tax will be raised to five percent from three percent from April 1 .

Bre-X , <PER> Barrick </PER> said to continue <LOC> Busang </LOC> talks . 

<PER> K.T. Arasu </PER> 

<LOC> JAKARTA </LOC> 1996-12-06 

<LOC> Canada </LOC> 's <ORG> Bre-X Minerals Ltd </ORG> and <ORG> Barrick Gold Corp </ORG> are to continue negotiations to hammer out a partnership agreement to develop the spectacular <LOC> Busang </LOC> gold find in <LOC> Indonesia </LOC> , sources close to the talks said on Friday . 

" The negotiations will be held both in <LOC> Toronto </LOC> and in <LOC> Jakarta </LOC> , " one source , speaking on condition of anonymity , told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> . 

Another source said most of the key negotiators from both <PER> Bre-X </PER> and <PER> Barrick </PER> had returned to <LOC> Toronto </LOC> , but declined to say if there had been any progress in their negotiations . 

Both sources said <PER> Bre-X </PER> and <PER> Barrick </PER> did not hold talks on Thursday with Mines and <ORG> Energy Ministry </ORG> Secretary-General <PER> Umar Said </PER> , who is coordinating the negotiations over the <LOC> Busang </LOC> find in <LOC> East Kalimantan </LOC> . 

The first source also said <PER> Bre-X </PER> had until December 21 to submit to the <ORG> Indonesian Mines and Energy Ministry </ORG> a feasibility study on the central region of the <LOC> Busang </LOC> property , estimated to contain 2.6 million ounces of gold . 

The richest parts of the property to the north and south of the central region have been estimated by Bre-X to contain 57 million ounces of gold . 

" Bre-X is expected to complete the feasibility report by December 16 and submit it to the government before the December 21 deadline , " the source said . 

He said <PER> Bre-X </PER> would then formally seek the permission of the <MISC> Indonesian </MISC> government to begin construction to develop <LOC> Busang </LOC> 's central region , which might take up to two years . 

The source declined to say if there had been any progress in the talks between <LOC> Bre-X </LOC> and <LOC> Barrick </LOC> . 

" This is a huge project ... 

we are not selling furniture , and <PER> Bre-X </PER> has 13,000 shareholders to answer to , " the source said . 

" While there has been some agreement in principle on some issues , there are still others such as procedures and mechanisms that needed to be sorted out , " he added . 

The source said no new deadline had been set by the <ORG> Mines and Energy Ministry for Bre-X </ORG> and <ORG> Barrick </ORG> to strike a deal . 

The <ORG> Ministry </ORG> had given the companies until December 4 to complete a partnership deal , and advised <ORG> Bre-X </ORG> to take a 25 percent stake and <ORG> Barrick </ORG> 75 percent to develop the property . 

" As far as I am aware , there 's been no new deadline , " the source said . 

The <ORG> Ministry 's Umar </ORG> said on Thursday that both <ORG> Bre-X </ORG> and <ORG> Barrick </ORG> had responded positively to a government letter recommending a 25-75 split in the <LOC> Busang </LOC> gold property . 

The government also wants 10 percent of the property . 

<PER> Umar </PER> said the government had yet to receive a formal reply from the companies . 

He had said earlier that if the two companies failed to reach a partnership agreement , the government would explore other ways to expedite development of the <LOC> Busang </LOC> find . 

<ORG> Bre-X </ORG> has a partnership deal with <ORG> PT Panutan Duta </ORG> of the <ORG> Panutan Group </ORG> run by President <PER> Suharto </PER> 's eldest son , <PER> Sigit Harjojudanto </PER> , under which <LOC> Panutan </LOC> would receive $ 40 million over 40 months plus a 10 percent stake <LOC> Busang </LOC> 's richest parts . 

<ORG> Barrick </ORG> has teamed up with a construction company in the <LOC> Citra Group </LOC> of <LOC> Suharto </LOC> 's eldest daughter , <PER> Siti Hardianti Rukmana </PER> , in what <PER> Barrick </PER> had said was a partnership " to prepare us for a potential mining development project " .

FEATURE - <ORG> Singapore </ORG> sees prestige in hosting WTO . 

<PER> Ramthan Hussain </PER> 

<LOC> SINGAPORE </LOC> 1996-12-06 

<ORG> Singapore </ORG> 's winning campaign to host the <ORG> World Trade Organisation </ORG> ( <ORG> WTO </ORG> ) 's first ministerial meeting reflected its ambition to play a key role in shaping global free trade , the lifeblood of its economy , analysts said . 

" As one of the world 's most externally oriented economies , <LOC> Singapore </LOC> has a disproportionately large stake in the <ORG> WTO </ORG> , " said <PER> Desmond Supple </PER> , economist at research house <LOC> I.D.E.A </LOC> . 

" <LOC> Singapore </LOC> stands to benefit more than most from continued global trade liberalisation as trade is the engine of its growth , accounting for nearly three times its gross domestic product . " 

The city-state met <LOC> U.S. </LOC> opposition two years ago in its bid to host the meeting , expected to gather 4,000 officials from 160 countries from December 9 to 13 . 

In a stand some analysts linked to controversy over <LOC> Singapore </LOC> 's caning of an <MISC> American </MISC> teenager for vandalism , <ORG> then-U.S. Trade </ORG> Representative <PER> Mickey Kantor </PER> had said the meeting ought to be held where the <ORG> WTO </ORG> was going to be headquartered . 

That would have meant <LOC> Geneva </LOC> . 

But <PER> Singapore </PER> had the support of other <ORG> WTO </ORG> members . 

<PER> Derek da Cunha </PER> , senior fellow at the <ORG> Institute of Policy Studies </ORG> ( <ORG> ISEAS </ORG> ) , said <PER> Singapore </PER> 's hosting of the conference " carries a great deal of symbolism for the city-state , underscoring its commitment to free trade and its trading links across the globe . " 

There is the international prestige <LOC> Singapore </LOC> would enjoy , but " more importantly there is a genuine national interest in fostering better global free trade and an open market " , said <PER> Tan Kong Yam </PER> , head of <ORG> Business Policy </ORG> at the <ORG> National University of Singapore </ORG> . 

At the ministerial meeting , trade ministers will review the work of the <ORG> WTO </ORG> and the implementation of the <ORG> Uruguay Round </ORG> free trade commitments under its predecessor the <ORG> General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade </ORG> ( <ORG> GATT </ORG> ) . 

In June , the <ORG> WTO </ORG> hailed <ORG> Singapore </ORG> for its open market policies but the <ORG> European Union </ORG> and other trading powers called on <LOC> Singapore </LOC> to speed up the opening of its services sector . 

<PER> Supple </PER> said the struggle that <PER> Singapore </PER> had to wage in vying to host the meeting would be repeated during the talks . 

" There is tension at every step of the way , " since a battle line between the <MISC> West </MISC> and developing countries has been drawn over the issue of linking trade liberalisation with labour rights , he said . 

<PER> Supple </PER> said hosting the meeting carried prestige for <LOC> Singapore </LOC> , " however , this is quite intangible as the prestige factor may not necessarily lead to any additional investment and trade flows to this region . " 

From a commercial point of view , the meeting would be good for <LOC> Singapore </LOC> 's tourism industry , <PER> Tan </PER> said . 

A large part of <LOC> Singapore </LOC> 's workforce would be mobilised to ensure the meeting would run without a glitch but the average <MISC> Singaporean </MISC> " would probably not be too concerned about some of the issues , " <PER> Tan </PER> said . 

" But the more educated public will realise that these kind of things are important for <LOC> Singapore </LOC> as a small economy . " 

<PER> Supple </PER> said any political gains the <ORG> Singapore </ORG> government would get from the <ORG> WTO </ORG> meeting -- ahead of a general election due by April 1997 -- would depend on how successful it was in pushing its economic agenda . 

" If there are any movements toward freer trade , then <LOC> Singapore </LOC> 's economy and the electorate would gain , " he said . " 

But I do n't think it would be wise to play up the political aspect of this . 

I think political issues will take secondary importance to all these economic issues that will be displayed . "

<ORG> Japan NTT </ORG> says hopes to start int'l business soon . 

<LOC> TOKYO </LOC> 1996-12-06 

<ORG> Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp </ORG> ( <ORG> NTT </ORG> ) said on Friday that it hopes to move into the international telecommunications business as soon as possible following the government 's decision to split NTT into three firms under a holding company . 

" We hope to start international telephone business as soon as possible , " a company official told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> . 

The official said the latest government decision to split the company under a holding company would allow flexibility in <ORG> NTT </ORG> 's international phone business . 

Earlier , <ORG> Posts </ORG> and Telecommunications Minister <PER> Hisao Horinouchi </PER> told a news conference the government plans to split <ORG> NTT </ORG> into three firms under a holding company , but did not specify when the restructuring would likely take effect . 

One of the three new companies will be a long-distance operator and the other two will be local-call operators , <PER> Horinouchi </PER> said . 

One of the local firms will operate in west <LOC> Japan </LOC> and the other in east <LOC> Japan </LOC> , he added . 

The long-distance operator will offer international services , <PER> Horinouchi </PER> said . 

The <ORG> NTT </ORG> official said the timing of the planned split-up was uncertain because more discussions by government officials were required .

CRICKET - <PER> WOOLMER </PER> MAKES SENTIMENTAL RETURN TO <ORG> KANPUR </ORG> . 

<LOC> KANPUR </LOC> , <LOC> India </LOC> 1996-12-07 

<LOC> South Africa </LOC> 's trip to <LOC> Kanpur </LOC> for the third test against <LOC> India </LOC> has given former <LOC> England </LOC> test cricketer <PER> Bob Woolmer </PER> the chance of a sentimental return to his birthplace . 

<PER> Woolmer </PER> was born in the northern city of <LOC> Kanpur </LOC> when his father worked there for an insurance compnay and was himself an active cricketer . 

" It 's been a sentimental journey ... 

A visit to <LOC> India </LOC> is always an intriguing experience , " <PER> Woolmer </PER> , now the <MISC> South African </MISC> coach , said on Saturday . 

<PER> Woolmer </PER> , 48 , played 19 tests for <LOC> England </LOC> between 1975 and 1981 . 

His first cricketing <PER> sojurn </PER> to <LOC> India </LOC> was as a member of <LOC> Tony Greig </LOC> 's <LOC> England </LOC> side in 1976-77 . 

His father <ORG> Clarence Woolmer </ORG> represented <ORG> United Province </ORG> , now renamed <PER> Uttar Pradesh </PER> , in <LOC> India </LOC> 's <ORG> Ranji Trophy </ORG> national championship and captained the state during 1949 . 

Now aged 86 , <PER> Woolmer </PER> senior lives with his son in <LOC> Cape Town </LOC> . 

Woolmer 's memories of <ORG> Kanpur </ORG> are few and blurred . 

" I do n't remember much of the place , " he said . " 

I came here on zero and left at three ( aged three ) when my father was transferred to <LOC> Calcutta </LOC> where I spent another four and half years . 

" But I do remember we had a cobra snake in the basement of our house . 

Also that my father bought a bicycle and when we rode over a hose pipe it broke into two . " 

<PER> Woolmer </PER> said the hospital where he was born is close to the stadium where the <LOC> India-South Africa </LOC> test will be played .

ALPINE SKIING-OFFICIALS HOPE TO SALVAGE WORLD CUP WEEKEND . 

<LOC> WHISTLER </LOC> , <LOC> British Columbia </LOC> 1996-12-06 

<MISC> World Cup </MISC> ski officials hope to be able to get in at least one men 's downhill training run on Saturday in an effort to salvage the weekend racing programme . 

For the third consecutive day , Friday 's scheduled training runs were cancelled due to heavy wet snow and fog on <LOC> Whistler Mountain </LOC> , leaving the scheduled <MISC> World Cup </MISC> events in jeopardy . 

Rules call for at least one training run to be completed before a <MISC> World Cup </MISC> downhill race can be staged . 

Organisers hope to get that run in on Saturday morning , conditions permitting , and stage the race later in the day or on Sunday . 

" There was no possibility today to make a training run , " said <PER> Bernd Zobel </PER> , the <MISC> Canadian </MISC> men 's national coach , citing too much new snow and poor visibility . 

If organisers are forced to run the downhill on Sunday , the super-giant slalom originally scheduled for Sunday would likely be abandoned .

<ORG> RUGBY UNION </ORG> - <PER> RETIRING </PER> CAMPESE WEIGHS UP OPTIONS . 

<LOC> LONDON </LOC> 1996-12-07 

<ORG> David Campese </ORG> will consider offers to play club rugby in <LOC> England </LOC> but looks more likely to spend the next year chasing business opportunities in <LOC> Australia </LOC> . 

The 34-year-old winger played his final game in a <LOC> Wallaby </LOC> jersey on Saturday but is currently a target for clubs eager to match <LOC> London </LOC> side <ORG> Saracens </ORG> who have already snapped up <ORG> Francois Pienaar </ORG> , <PER> Michael Lynagh </PER> and <PER> Philippe Sella </PER> . 

" If the opportunity is there I 'd obviously think about it but the thing that holds me back is business , " said <PER> Campese </PER> . 

" I 'd like to come over but there are a lot of things happening at home . 

I 've also got a contract to play for <LOC> New South Wales </LOC> in the Super 12 next year . " 

Former <LOC> Wallaby </LOC> captain <PER> Nick Farr-Jones </PER> believes <PER> Campese </PER> may yet be tempted to <LOC> England </LOC> . 

" I 'm sure there are a few people in <LOC> England </LOC> who 'd be delighted to have <PER> David Campese </PER> in their club 's jersey , " he said .

SOCCER - <PER> ENGLISHMAN </PER> CHARLTON IS MADE AN HONORARY IRISHMAN . 

<LOC> DUBLIN </LOC> 1996-12-07 

<PER> Jack Charlton </PER> 's relationship with the people of <LOC> Ireland </LOC> was cemented on Saturday when the <MISC> Englishman </MISC> was officially declared one of their own . 

<PER> Charlton </PER> , 61 , and his wife , <PER> Peggy </PER> , became citizens of <LOC> Ireland </LOC> when they formally received <MISC> Irish </MISC> passports from deputy Prime Minister <PER> Dick Spring </PER> who said the honour had been made in recognition of <PER> Charlton </PER> 's achievements as the national soccer manager . 

" The years I spent as manager of the <LOC> Republic of Ireland </LOC> were the best years of my life . 

It all culminated in the fact that I now have lots of great , great friends in <LOC> Ireland </LOC> . 

That is why this is so emotional a night for me , " <PER> Charlton </PER> said . 

" It was the joy that we all had over the period , that I shared with people that I grew to love , that I treasure most , " he added . 

<PER> Charlton </PER> managed <LOC> Ireland </LOC> for 93 matches , during which time they lost only 17 times in almost 10 years until he resigned in December 1995 . 

He guided <LOC> Ireland </LOC> to two successive <MISC> World Cup </MISC> finals tournaments and to the 1988 <MISC> European </MISC> championship finals in <LOC> Germany </LOC> , after the <MISC> Irish </MISC> beat a well-fancied <LOC> England </LOC> team 1-0 in their group qualifier . 

The lanky former <PER> Leeds United </PER> defender did not make his <LOC> England </LOC> debut until the age of 30 but eventually won 35 caps and was a key member of the 1966 <MISC> World Cup </MISC> winning team with his younger brother , <PER> Bobby </PER> .
